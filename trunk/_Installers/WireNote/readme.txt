Description
-------------------------
Note / Todo / Reminder / LAN Messenger / Address book utility.
WireNote is a smart personal data manager and messaging application. 
Attach Sticky Notes and ToDos to the desktop or to any other 
application's window. Schedule Reminders to perform one or more 
actions at a set date and time. Use WireNote's high-quality LAN 
messaging (including send/receive files and message filtering) 
instead of WinPopup or Windows messaging service. WireNote also 
has a built-in, powerful anti-spam module. All of WireNote's 
windows automatically "dock" when they get near each other. Store 
any kind of data in several different ways and access it at any 
time either from the main WireNote window or from the tray icon 
menu. You may never forget anything again.
