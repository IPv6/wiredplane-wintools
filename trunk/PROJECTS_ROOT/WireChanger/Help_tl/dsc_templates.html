<h1>Templates</h1><hr>
Tempates can greatly change look-and-feel of your wallpaper. Template can be activated via tray menu or preferences. Active template adds to wallpaper additional processing or useful 
and even interactive object. Additionally, every active template adds special items to the tray menu of WireChanger. This can be quick way to change options of template or quick way to edit template-related data. Let`s look on the basic templates in WireChanger:
<br>- <b>Calendar</b>. This template will add semi-transparent interactive calendar to your background. Calendar is highly customizable and even skinnable. You can add text notes to the cells of the calendar by double clicking it right on your desktop.

To add note for future dates (that are not visible on calendar) double click calendar`s title.
<br>- <b>Citations</b>. Using this template you will be able to read random citation right over your wallpaper every time it changes.

<br><br>Some notes about transparency under Windows 98/ME: It is better not to use transparency under that versions of Windows, because they are not support transparency natively (contrary to Windows 2000, Windows XP and higher). So it is advised
to set opacity to 100

<h1>For developers</h1><br>
Template is the simple HTML page or page with special draw script with preprocesing commands which wraps your wallpaper with different effects.
Templates will be applied even to images, that are installed as wallpaper from other programs. You can find all templates in 'Template' folder in WireChanger`s installation directory (*.wpt files). You can add new 
templates easily - just look at existing template files. Remember, that additional files used by WireChanger are cashed for performance purposes, so if you add/remove some strings to/from them, 
you must restart whole application.
