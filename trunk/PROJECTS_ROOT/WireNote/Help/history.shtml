<tr><td><b>ver 2.0.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Added:<br>
- New network protocol added - Billboard ('/fb'). This protocol was specially designed for
non-standard LANs with mixed environment, where standard messaging tools simply cannot be used.
The only requirement for Billboard protocol is the shared folder with read/write properties, 
which must be visible from WireNote`s users. Commonly, this is the folder on the central LAN File server (for example).
Example: one part of the LAN is behind the NAT server or firewall and this firewall/NAT blocks all connections from the inside.
But this is not a problem for WireNote! With Billboard protocol, you even don`t have to see your partner in the network neighbourhood!
Just point your WireNotes to one shared folder - and you will be able to establish message exchange between your computers :)
<br>Additionally, Billboard supports <b>"Find online users"</b> operation. But note: this protocol is not secured at this time. We will add security layer later<br>
