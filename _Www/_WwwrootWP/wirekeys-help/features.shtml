<h2>WireKeys Features</h2><hr>

This tool is focused on hotkeys mainly. Keyboard hotkey can be created from <b>any key combination you can imagine</b>
and can even include <b>mouse buttons clicks and mouse wheel spinning</b> or buttons at your gamepad or joystick. You can assign up to 3 hotkeys to any action 
and one hotkey to different actions to start them simultaneously at one keypress.
WireKeys features full "Win" key support, full multimedia keyboards support, full support for TV-tuner remote controls;
you can add to your <a href="hotkeys.shtml">hotkeys</a> such keys as "Esc", "BackSpace", "Caps Lock" and combinations like "Ctrl-A-B-C", "RAlt-D-O-I-T" (for example), 
re-assign system hotkeys and use Right and Left keys (such as Shift, Control, etc) in your hotkeys separately (i.e. 'Left alt-E' can start Explorer and 'Right alt-E' can start Opera or Mozilla browser). 
This gives you the real freedom in using your keyboard and other input devices.
<br>
Build-in macro support allows you to automate almost all aspects of everyday working with computer - file and directory manipulation, windows manipulation, text replacement, text processing, file download/upload, and more.
All parts of this application are highly integrated between each other. 
<hr>See the <a href="tutorial.shtml">Tutorial</a> for more information about features included here.

<h2>More detailed description</h2>

<table>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Additional clipboards + history of use</b></td>
<tr><td>
Helps in work with any application by providing additional text clipboards.
Very convinient for combining dicument from different text pieces, for example.
You will be able to copy and paste selected text to/from clips using hotkeys only.
You can check the content of any clipboard at any time in the hot menu.
Every clipboard have its own history of use. History of use is used to quickly insert one of the recently copied string (but not the last one).
WireKeys add clipboard history for standard clipboard too. Additionaly, you can enable transmit mode
(by choosing 'Transmit mode' in hot menu for target window) - any copy to additional clip will be automatically transmited (pasted) into target window.
Clipboards content/history are saved between shutdowns. You can also pin up pieces in clipboards history. Pinned pieces will not be pushed out from history list by other items. 
To pin up piece just hold SHIFT key while choosing item from history menu
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Screenshots</b></td>
<tr><td>
You can automatically save screenshots in bmp or jpg formats. WireKeys can even save screenshots
periodically. WireKeys gives you the ability to make screenshots of the whole screen or the
active application only or a rectangular area of interest. Press a hotkey, hold the mouse button,
and drag the rectangle. You can also define a different behavior for double-pressing the hotkey.
For example, if you are using 'Alt-F12' as your screenshot key to get the whole display, you can
set the 'Active window only' behavior to the automatically handled hotkey 'Alt-F12-F12' (press
'F12' twice while holding 'Alt'). The screenshot will be automatically saved in a file, and can
be signed; that is, the current date and time will be included on the screenshot. (The file name
and sign string support parametrization). There is an option to automatically open a created
screenshot in the image editor and an option to show the snapshot's area and position while
dragging the mouse. During rectangular snapping, you can right-click the mouse to send the cursor
to the opposite corner of the rectangle. Also, you can make screenshots of video windows, if you
enable special support for such windows in the screenshot's preferences.<br>
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Keyboard (or text) macros</b></td>
<tr><td>
Powerful feature. Macro can be called by hotkey or from quick-run menu and can be written in JScript or VBScript.
<br>One type of macro will call any application with substituted parameters. Using this type of macro you can, for example,
select email address in any application and create a new email message with  the selected address as recipient by pressing hotkey
(in this example macro must have 'application path' set to 'mailto:' and 'parameters' set to '%SELECTED').
Or select a word and open search results for this word in Google by pressing another hotkey.
<br>Second type of macro will execute macro code with selected text as parameter and put the result 
back in the active application. See preinstalled macros to understand how it works.
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Offscreen windows</b></td>
<tr><td>
There are hotkeys to quickly bring back into screen windows, that are placed outside the screen boundaries.
"Windows traits" plugin can prevent windows from being moved beyond screen edges completely.
Useful, for example, for windows which title bar is used to be hidden by monitor`s upper border.
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Text layout conversion</b></td>
<tr><td>
Useful when you type some text in wrong keyboard layout (in any application) and don`t want (and now you don`t have to)
retype it in correct layout
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Process killer</b></td>
<tr><td>
You can list all started processes and their memory usage through the main menu or a hot menu and
kill a 'not responding' process (if you have admin rights to do so). You can also change the
process priority (and more) by right-clicking a process name in the processes submenu.  
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Tray minimizer</b></td>
<tr><td>
WireKeys can minimize any window to tray or hide it completely. Hidden window will be reachable through tray or main WireKeys menu.
The main difference from other competitor with such possibility: minimized apllication`s main menu will be still reachable through icon-in-tray context menu. 
And if you select an item from tray submenu, it will be added to the top menu level too for quick access in the future. 
Such moved items will be saved between WireKeys startups, so you haven`t to redefine them again and again. 
Though this may not work with some application. You can view and use system menu of the hidden to tray window also - 
just hold "Shift" key while opening tray menu. Additional "Windows traits" plugin can minimize window to tray 
by right-clicking its minimize button. Hidden to tray application can be detached from tray into small floating window.
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Run selected as from command string / Inline calculator</b></td>
<tr><td>
As simple as it`s sounds.
Extremely useful when you receive link to some document. With this feature you don`t need to open you file browser and drill down to desired location - just select link and press a hotkey, 
and corresponding application will be executed for you! If you double-press this hotkey, an history menu will be popuped, so you don`t have to remember your last actions. This operation detects console applications and start them in separate "cmd.exe" session, so you can check out the results. Try to select and 'Run as from command string' 
this text: "ping www.wiredplane.com". You can also 'run' arithmetical expressions, in this case the result will be inserted at the cursor position automatically. To be treated as expression selected string must end on '=' char.
You can even use trigonometrical functions as Math.sin(...) / Math.cos(...) and so on! Calculator based on Java-Script engine. 
You can also perform simple conversions between different scales of notation (conversion between arbitary bases): try to "run" following strings 
- '111(2->10)=', '7(10->2)=', 'FF(16->10)=', '255(10->16)='. This convertor also supports character base designators (B, O, D, H), so you can use expressions like "(100+99)(D to H)=" (this mean "calculate 100+99 and convert from decimal to hex").
And to addition to all this stuff, "Run as..." supports smart keywords (similar to opera/firefox smart keywords/searches) (<a href="http://www.wiredplane.com/wirekeys-help/smart_keywords.shtml">Smart keywords info</a>).
Try to "Run as.." following line: "g Wiredplane"
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Quick run</b></td>
<tr><td>
With this feature you can run any application or open folder or internet link by simply pressing a hotkey.
You can also hide newly started application to tray or maximize/minimize it automatically.
There is option to popup already started application instead of starting another one.
Quick-run application can be automatically positioned, sized (user-defined size and position) 
and pinned after start. It can be also started from specified directory. 
You can also add additional icon to tray. Double click this icon to start corresponding application. If you detach this icon into floater, you will be able to browse startup directory from tray/floater menu.
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Quick shutdown</b></td>
<tr><td>
Shutdown with auto-power off can be cancelled approximately 2 seconds after initialization.
(Note: 'power off' requires special hardware support.) WireKeys can automatically kill some
applications before shutdown. Shutdown can be converted into a restart sequence if the shutdown
hotkey is pressed twice. Note that "Extreme" shutdown speed will not leave
any chance for applications to save their data. The main actions performed by Windows during
"Extreme" shutdown are flushing the file cache and saving personal
settings. 
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Volume control</b></td>
<tr><td>
Just hotkeys to change system sound volume up and down from 0% to 100%
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Boss key</b></td>
<tr><td>
With this key you can hide various windows from the desktop very quickly. This is a very useful
feature if you don't want your boss or colleagues to spy on your activity. Just press the hotkey
and your favorite game (or Internet browser, or any other program) instantly disappears from the
desktop and Ctrl+Alt+Del list. Later, you just press another hotkey and the hidden program
appears on the desktop again. Additionally, you can overlay your screen with your most recently
created screenshot. 
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Desktop switcher (Win NT/2000/XP only)</b></td>
<tr><td>
You can dynamically create additional desktops and use them in a flash. WireKeys remembers the
desktop layout for each desktop and sets screen resolution for each desktop independently - very
useful for designers.
</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="AAAAAA"><b>Additional plugins</b></td>
<tr><td>
See <a href="plugins.shtml">corresponding page</a> for description of preinstalled plugins.
