For Immediate Release

Wiredplane.com Release WireChanger 3.0


New wallpaper manager proves all so-called wallpaper experts wrong.


WireChanger may not be a household name, but it sure is creating big waves
in the small community of wallpaper collectors and creators.  The reason for 
that is a new feature that does what all "wallpaper experts" thought was 
impossible - the software allows users to run animated wallpapers, while 
having sticky notes, calendars, Flash clocks, search boxes or screenmates
displayed at the same time on the desktop.  But that's certainly not the
only unique feature invented by the developers of WireChanger.

For instance, WireChanger does not just change wallpapers - it's the first
one in this market to animate the process and offer transition effects.  
Other handy options include capability to perform web searches or translate
foreign words directly form the desktop.  Plus, WireChanger can deliver
webcam shots, play videos and display latest news from CNN directly to
the desktop.

WireChanger not only makes PC desktop more beautiful, it also helps people
in their everyday activities.  For instance, the program can install a
calendar as wallpaper.  If necessary, users can add a list of tasks they
need to do on specified days or during specified time period.  Or mark
friends and colleagues' birthdays. Plus, WireChanger even comes with 
a weather forecast template that is a must have for any company or 
individual whose business depends of weather conditions.

WireChanger is perfect for the owners of large wallpaper collections and
works without a glitch even if there are thousands of wallpapers stored
on the hard drive.  The program also supports all products by well-known
providers of animated wallpaper and clocks, like Elefun Desktop and ColClocks.

WireChanger 3.0 is distributed electronically over the Internet; free
demo version is available at www.wiredplane.com for evaluation.  

The price of a single copy is 20.00 US Dollars. 

If you have any questions, would like to request editor's copy, want to
inquire about special prices for volume buyers/software resellers,
or have a business proposal, please contact WirePlane.com staff
