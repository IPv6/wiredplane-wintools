<b>WiredPlane.com Announces WireKeys 2.8</b>
<hr>
Innovative operating system functionality expansion and control software released February 10, 2005
<br><br>
February 10, 2005 WiredPlane.com announced version 2.8 of its all-inclusive MS Windows enhancement software allowing PC users take full control over the operating system interface and performance. WireKeys adds unlimited additional clipboards as well as additional virtual desktops for uncluttered data representation. Besides that, the application includes inline calculator capable of calculating math formulae from '2+2=' to complex JS-syntax expressions, text case and codepage\layout changer and windows management (including window opacity, automatic hiding to TaskTray, setting process priority and killing a process). With WireKeys it is easy to preserve icons positions on desktop, set the desired sound volume system-wide, restrict access to a PC as well as turn it on\off and optimize memory usage. Additional tools allow for CD\DVD drive(s) control, screen resolution settings adjusting and processes management.
<br><br>
WireKeys is intended for a broad range of Windows users who would like to take full control over operating system casual and hidden features by using customizable keyboard shortcuts and context menus. WireKeys is available in English, Spanish, Italian, Russian and Ukrainian. The application functionality can be further expanded by installing plug-ins available both from WiredPlane.com and third party developers. The all-in-one architecture of this software not only means better integrity but also allows for cutting additional software investments at least twice.
<br><br>
"As we have studied the existing Windows functionality enhancement products, we have found virtually none of them offers tight integration with OS interface while offering power additions to system shell," - said Ilya Razinkov, the CEO of WiredPlane.com. "When creating WireKeys we strived to bring the latest and greatest Windows enhancements (including windows transparency, extended window size and position management, hot key control and virtual desktops) together to form up an integrated Windows control system available at an affordable price!"
<br><br>
According to Mr. Razinkov, "WiredPlane.com did its very best to come up with complete Windows management automation and productivity solution allowing PC users concentrate on important tasks while keeping all the functionality of operating system, including hidden features, available with just a key press!"
