Ups, fixed! Thanks that you find a time to write about this grammatical mistakes. Thanks for you responsiveness too :) Though i spend more time to my family for now (rather then programming and trialwaring:) ), but it is always pleasing to help with the things that are pleasing to do :))

P.S. And BTW - Thanks for  http://web.archive.org/ (just checked out what is this - great project, 100% useful favourite link)!!! :) this is very nice that nothing was loosed from FF "disconnection". I`ll miss Fabulous Freeware :( As far as i can see, they are closed, becouse nothing changed about their web-site for 4 months. It`s a pitty :(
