Hi 
Can't see how to " reply" on forum, it is very difficult to even get into the forum for me to make a post-took me since last week for these two posts!

I can re-size taskbar, close all Apps and re-start-no effect. I also use another app (for years) Called "Hook 99" -http://lbrisar.htmlplanet.com/e_hook.html#top

But I ONLY use this app to make ALL taskbar icons small
(square instead of rectangular).I do NOT use it for the Start button graphics. Is it likely that this conflicts with WireKeys?
If you think this is the problem, then I will uninstall it (after 7 years usage!)but if I do, can I control the SIZE of the taskbar icons from inside WireKeys? Thanks for your help. Ian.
