Ilja, 

I've forgotten exactly what I said.  I merely meant PM as a casual hello while recognizing you're up late working.

"working late" -- staying at jobsite past typical working hours (e.g., 8 to 5 for day job); performing work then.  Encompasses working at home near or after bedtime at night for day job elsewhere.  I'm assuming Wiredplane Labs is an "in the evening and on weekends at home" second job/remunerative hobby.

"up late" -- awake past typical bedtime.  Staring at the ceiling wishing you could sleep usually doesn't count without further qualification.
