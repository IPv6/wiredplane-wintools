Insertion macros aren't working for me.  For example I can't insert %date via a hotkey in the text of this message.  This is the first time I've tried using insertion macros, so I'm wondering if this is something weird (and possibly temporary) on my system or if you have encountered this before?

Is there an obvious way to predict which applications will accept insertion macros and which won't?

Thanks,
Bill
