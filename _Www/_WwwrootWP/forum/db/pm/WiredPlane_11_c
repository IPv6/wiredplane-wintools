So if I use this hotkey to lock the keyboard--is it really locked ? I mean can I use it to more or less scrub my keys clean whilst I wait for something to download? or will I get an error by pressing 25 keys at once ! Just curious as the ONLY time I ever notice dirty keys is when pc is on . Thanks for any reply. Ian.
