Hello!!! :)
 Can you send screenshot of this? for now WK about semms to show right version (just checked again). may be it is a problem of installer - it wasn`t able to overwrite file.
to be sure - check "Extended hotkey processing" section and look at the "Hide mouse cursor while typing" checkbox - is it present here?
By the way, i`ve fixed problems with the hotkey guide you`ve noticed in the forum. Hope you`ll like it :)
