Ilja,
I must have a mental block where this is concerned.

    %MMM %d, %yyyy 
--> 08MM %d, %yyyy 

    %M %D %Y 
--> 08 20 2004 

Clearly the lower two tables in the help file are strictly format characters.  What is the syntax?  Where is it documented?  RTFM with a citation is fine.

BTW, the Search tab in Help is confusing.  Does it search anything besides the plugin example?
