Last year I requested a hot key for emtying R Bin, and you thanked me for the suggestion.

When you launched version 2.8.1 it was added as an option, but it only emptied the bin on drive " C " and when I commented about this on the forum the reply was " We have found a bug in this and it will be corrected in a future build"

Was only wondering about current status. Thanks. Ian.
