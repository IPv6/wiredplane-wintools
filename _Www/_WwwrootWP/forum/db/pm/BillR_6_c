Thanks for noticing mistakes :) I am learning English while reading your messages and messages from other users and sometimes learning bad examples of language use.

About Zip: You may laugh at me, but it seems that you start download zip in the middle of the next joke of my ISP. If you wish, i can drill into details :) My ISP is suffering starting from the spring and i am seriously thinking about moving all site-related stuff from it. the only thing that stops me - lazyness :) and continued promises from isp.
