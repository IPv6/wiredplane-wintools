Yes, it is really locked. None of the pressed keys while kb is locked are reaching system.

May be i didn`t understand what you asking, please clarify %)

And sorry for late answer, just didn`t mention private messaegs... It is better to use support@wiredplane.com for such question %) So if you wish to know more or want query for additions to WK - just send email %)
Good luck!
