Hi Bill, Thanks for reply - I just spent 10 minutes trying to delete as instructed but my Del key has no effect on this page, if I highlight .xxxxxxx.  , or in fact any part or all of that line there is no option to delete and the Del key has no effect-so I gave up on trying to reply !

I was not aware of that Keypress and it was exactly what I wanted. All I need now is a way to stop my Taskbar icons disappearing behind my start button now ( Win 2000Pro) and all will be fine ! Many thanks for the tip. Ian.
