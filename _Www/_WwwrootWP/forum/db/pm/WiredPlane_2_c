Re: "WK zip - Bad File" ISP Problem
I think I can still hear the echo of grinding teeth.  I find it hard enough to deal with difficulties I create without having additional external ones imposed over which I have no control but must suffer through.

Registration
Thanks for fixing the problem with WK not recognizing my license for a while.  I was suddenly licensed again without even going through the registration process.

FYI
You have an update conflict.  To verify, I just downloaded WK again to be sure I had the latest version and then installed it (twice).  About still shows 21-Jul-04 and Check for Update still says there is a new version (24-Jul).  Zipped .exe is dated 24-Jul.

English
Did you recently take a class or are you specifically working on English?  I perceive continued  improvement even from the beginning of the year.

FYI (in the spirit of the preceeding.  If this makes you self-conscious when informally communicating with me I'd much rather skip it.  Besides, I know I make plenty of mistakes when hurriedly typing and I'm a native speaker!)

"My ISP started to move hosting to another machine without noticing [notifying] me first." (Although it could be "noticing" as in overlooking that you were there.)

"delete[d] old file and receive[d] only [a] small part of a new one and disconnect[ed]"
