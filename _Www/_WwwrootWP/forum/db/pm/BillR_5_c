Yes, thanks, the problem was fixed some days ago.
My ISP started to move hosting to another machine without noticing me first :( When i started to upload new file, ftp server (due its semi-transfer state) delete old file and receive only small part of a new one and disconnect me for some days :( 

Very frustrating situation :(
