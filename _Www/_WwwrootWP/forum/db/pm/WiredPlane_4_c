Re: Further checking
I don't particularly care.  Just FYI.

Re: English
I'm impressed.  Some people who have lived here for a few years don't do much better.

When you have known problems -- and can get to your site -- you might want to let people know.  I think that will provide reassurance that you are aware of whatever the problem is and are working on it.  The notice could be as simple as adding a new message on the front page, although many probably wouldn't see it there.  The download page would be an even better location.  

The message needn't be more than a few words or a brief paragraph: "Due to ongoing ISP server changes since late July, the zip files may be the prior version."  You'll probably be more concise.
