$pcontent="Hello!
Maybe i am bad with searching and it has been answered already, but i would like to ask anyway :)
Is it possible with this program to set hotkeys for standart windows folder context menu item(s) ? More specific, i am looking for ability to execute &#34;Play in winamp&#34; for folder contents (it is line in right-click folder menu).
Thank you in advance!";
