$pcontent="First, thanks for the great program.

I have a feature suggestion. I feel it is redundant to have three options (add to do, add notes, add reminder). Why don&#39;t combine them into one &#34;add notes&#34;, then allows users to add reminders only if needed, as the function is already available.

This should make the program more compact and clean.

Thank you.";
