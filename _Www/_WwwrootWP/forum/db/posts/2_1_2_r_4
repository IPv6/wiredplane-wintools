2Moon, About PowerPro:
&#34;No user menus or toolbars&#34; - we make accent on hotkeys so this is leaved for other tools :) May be someone will wrote plugin for this stuff?
&#34;No mouse actions&#34; - Common mouse action will be added with new &#34;Mouse gestures&#34; plugin soon
&#34;No desktop control&#34; - this is already added to WK2 (will be released soon)
&#34;No timers, no sceduler, no notes...&#34; - we have our WireNote PIM+Lan messenger for this stuff

Hm... Just 2 to 5% of WinPowerPro&#39;s features. No mouse actions, no user menus or toolbars, no timers, no sceduler, no desktop control, no notes...

So, how does it compare to Windows Power Pro http://www.windowspowerpro.com/ ? Is it worth switching?

Thanks for feedback and suggestions :) We will implement them in the next releases (starting from additional desktops)

Thumbs up, high! Great utility!

I have one suggestion, add the ability to create your own sub categories (similar to the quickrun, misc etc.) so I can sort my apps.
