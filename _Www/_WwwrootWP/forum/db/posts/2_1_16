$pcontent="I&#39;m so demanding...  ;-)

I decided to give up on Winamp since it uses way too much system resources for me. I have found another audio player that is awesome. It&#39;s called dbPowerAmp  http://www.dbpoweramp.com

It is so lightweight but has great features. You should check it out...

Anyway, they have great Visual Basic controls at http://www.dbpoweramp.com  I thought maybe it would be easy to control dbPowerAmp through Wirekeys. Maybe set a hotkey to show artist and track in the OSD? 

Here is the page with the developer tools:

Don&#39;t implement just for me, but maybe more people like dbPowerAmp too...";
