I read the pattern section, and I simply cannot figure out the syntax for specifying a date/time of a particular format (listed at the bottom). %DATE:yyyyMMdd fails, as well as %DATE:yyyyMMdd%. It seems it evaluates %DATE before anything, and thus doesn&#39;t consider the specified format. Oh well, I suppose it isn&#39;t a major issue.

By the way... normally I would actually register in the forums having asked this much (despite my appreciation for the ability not to have to). The reason I haven&#39;t is because my E-mail (webmail) server is... doing something odd. It gives me an error upon attempting to login. First time anything like that has happened in 6+ years. I guess I should start using my Gmail account, heh. I just hate to risk it getting spammed like mad.

Thanks again. I hope you had a happy new year as well,
