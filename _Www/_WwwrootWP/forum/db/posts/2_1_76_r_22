$rsubject="RE: [ANN] WireKeys updates";
$rcontent="WK3.3.4 released.
- Ability to put on desktop link to any action (expand action`s hotkey to find out how)
- Ability to add wkm macros into WireKeys by simply double-clicking its file
- New macros api, for example to load URLs into JScript variable. This gives great ability to retrieve different information directly into macro. As an example you can look at rambler`s translations macro at this site
Fixed:
- Crash after applying changes to recorded macro without reopening preferences
