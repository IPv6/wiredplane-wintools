I have created a shared folder on a network machine (and tested it) and entered its full network path (&#92;&#92;comsec-intel&#92;netreminders) in the preferences &#39;shared folder&#39;. I have switched on shared reminders and by default and a &#39;shared&#39; folder has appeared in the organiser into which all new reminders are shown - but nothing appears in the shared folder. What am I doing wrong. Its a really great programme and this is one feature I would like to use.";
