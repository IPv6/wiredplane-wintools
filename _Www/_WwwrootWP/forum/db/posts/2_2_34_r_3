$rcontent="Thanks for your message!
For this particualr situation it seems everything can be fixed by the following steps: open WC preferences-&#62;System options-&#62;save wallpaper image into this file (set the path+file of your choice), than set the same path+image in the nVidia settings too. WC will not suggest to add this picture again, nVidia will resize it as needed for the second monitor.

Read the topic about screensaver for futher details.";
