$rcontent="It somewhat depends upon how easily &#34;favorites&#34; are to change.  One application I use makes this so easy that I don&#39;t mind that it doesn&#39;t track recently used.  That said, I wish it did track the most recent MRU as the first favorite each time.  That I want the add-on to do this is really a flaw in the underlying design of the dialogue.

I look forward to seeing the forthcoming plug-in for favorite folders.";
