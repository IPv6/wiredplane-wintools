$pcontent="Hi,

WireNote is realy very good program, but I have some problems to fully use it.
I can not use some national character (Polish) in wireNote.
To write this character it is needed to press right ALT and corresponding letter (e, o, a, s, l, z, x, c, n).
In ToDo module only ALT-O does not work (after removing some predefined shortcut in preferences).
In Notes module only ALT-z, ALT-x and ALT-c works. 
Is it possible to correct this in new version?
