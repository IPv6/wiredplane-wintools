$rcontent="Some questions to find out the reason:
1) Can you send us backup of your settings?
2) Which plugins are active? Is advanced hotkey processing is active too? Can you disable all [plugins and try to install new version again?
3) Did you use trial version of WK? How long you are using it?

Sorry for inconvinience :( We will update WK immediately after we find what is going on in your case :(";
