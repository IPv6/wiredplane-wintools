$rcontent="Hello!
We just uploaded WC with fixed screensaver on dual-monitor systems (at least we think so, because there is no way to test for us).
Can you test it wgen you`ll have spare time?
There is only one thing - after installing you should open &#34;preferences&#34; - &#34;screensaver&#34; and click on &#34;install as screensaver&#34; to replace actual screensaver with new one.
Please answer with any results ^)
Good luck!";
