$rcontent="Thanks for the update to WireKeys 3.6.7. :thmbup

I think the history notes are a little bit short, aren&#39;t they?
[quote]ver 3.6.6 
- Volume control in Vista[/quote] 
Where is 3.6.7? 

And - unfortunately - I didn&#39;t find the improvements suggested earlier (e.g. some posts above).  :?

May be, you can give some hints of improvements / bug fixes? :D
Thankyou.

cheers and beers
