Yes, WK lite has first versions of some plugins and they are not disabled, they work without limitations. WK 1.9.9 has no limitations at all (but a few bugs as can be seen from retrospective)

Older versions of WK will work without any limitations or nag screens for 14 days. After that period 
1) all plugins will be disabled (all their preferences will be saved for future re-enabling after registration is completed), including roll-up/hide window to title via window buttons (i.e. rclick on &#39;Minimize&#39; button). But rolling and hiding via defined hotkeys will work as always 
2) rare nag screen will appear and some additional strings will be added to preferences recommeding to register WK
3) after 90 days of use additional clipboards and anything related to paste operation will be disabled.

Macros and everything that will be in the preferences will work as advertised even after trial period is up :)

About recommendation: If the nag screen (rare) is not fatal to your friends, the unregistered 2.6.x and later releases are prefferable :) We are fixing bugs, adding features and improving usability, so there is no need to use lite version :)
