Maybe, You can add something like &#39;Find Option&#39; - small input line in the bottom of the screen, like i.e. in TOAD or in the TheBat!

&#34;Copy&#34; function (for hotkeys) could be useful. 

It&#39;s also good idea to ask confirmation before saving options file, if such file already exists

PS Well, I still use free version - maybe, it&#39;s fixed in the full version? 

PPS Do You plan special X-Mass version? It will be good reason to buy :-)";
