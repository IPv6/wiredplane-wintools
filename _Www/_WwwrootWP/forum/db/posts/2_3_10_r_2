$rcontent=" :P I looked hard to find it but I just didn&#39;t see it.
This brings me to a couple more things:
1) After I modify the x button to hide the note, the tooltip still says delete and not hide
2) I would also like to have a delete option in the menu (maybe  in the pin menu?)
3) I don&#39;t see any option to increase the point size of the font, but only to change the color.
4) Would it be possible to have the calendar stored in ical format (it is a standard supported by many other applications)
5) Check email on IMAP with/without SSL
I realize that 4) and 5) may be to hard to implement by one can always express a wish, right? ;-)
Ciao and thanks";
