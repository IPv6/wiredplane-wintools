$psubject="WireNote and WireKeys - no WK tray icon ";
$pcontent="Hi

experimented with WireNote and the WireNote-plugin for WK.

V1)
When WN and WK are running at the same time, I have NO WK-icon in the tray available. It is covered (or replaced) by the WireNOTE one.
BTW: WK&#39;s WireNote-plugin is NOT activated.

V2)
When I use WK with WireNote-Plugin activated, I have the WK-icon, but not the all the functions of WireNotes (sending msgs etc.)


Now I&#39;m in conflict:
Full notes with limited WK use
OR
Full WK use and limited Notes.

What&#39;s your suggestion for V1) ?
