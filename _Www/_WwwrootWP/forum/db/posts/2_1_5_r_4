Window Resizer does not work well on this on[/quote]
Hm, i just check this program - everything is work as expected. The only bad thing is that spelling window 
is not able to contain more than one line of text. Is that what you mean? This can be fixed, though this is not &#34;resizing&#34; deal - such attributes are set by dialog`s application

Will be done :)
