For the moment, I&#39;m just using notes. I see hotkeys to create a new note and show/hide all notes. My question is, after moving focus from a note to a different application, how do you bring that note back into focus via the keyboard? Since the notes don&#39;t appear in Windows tasklist, Alt-Tab doesn&#39;t find it.

If you press &#34;show all notes&#34;, that kind of works, but focus comes up on one (last one used?), and I can&#39;t find a way to keyboard cycle through the others to get to the one I want.

TIA";
