I try to explain my problem.

I have an hotkey to play next song with winamp.

the key is CTRL+ALT+Rightkey

i push the tree key simultanous and release the last key (rightkey) then winamp play next song.

i key pushed the ctrl and alt key.  when i push the rightkey again, the hotkey dosen&#39;t work.  

There is a timeout setting that i can change.... to make this...

exemple:

ctrl alt supp.......  winamp play next song
keep ctrl atl supp pressed..

5 seconde later

i press rightkey  to winamp change song...



It&#39;s hard to explain ....
