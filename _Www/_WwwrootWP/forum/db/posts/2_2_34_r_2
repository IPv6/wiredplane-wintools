$rsubject="RE: Dual Monitor support for WireChanger";
$rcontent="I, too, would like this feature.  Unfortunately, I think different display drivers require different implementations.  I have an Nvidia card with 2 monitors attached:

Primary monitor is set to 1600x1200.  This is the monitor Wirechanger uses to scale the wallpaper.

Secondary monitor is set to 1280x720 (widescreen), positioned to the left of the primary (so top left corner is at -1280 x 0).

Will the default settings, the secondary monitor shows a cropped version of the wallpaper on the primary monitor (showing the top right 1280x720 portion of the 1600x1200 image on the primary).

With nVidia&#39;s Desktop Manager enabled, there is also the option to have the second display take its background from a second, user-specified file.

So, ideally, I would like Wirechanger to be able to create a second background image in a user-specified file, using the resolution of the secondary monitor.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t figure out where to find this info in the registry.

Interestingly, the screensaver included with Wirechanger is able to use both displays (although it seems to change images on each display at very random intervals, sometimes; often, one continues changing at the user-specified interval, while the other will stay static for a long time, but I haven&#39;t figured out any pattern to it).

Edit:  OK, I just played around with the option to use a different image for the second display, and Wirechanger didn&#39;t like it!  When I set the second monitor to use a different image, Wirechanger instantly popped up message asking if I wanted to add the new image to the collection.  Whether I did or not, it then messed up the wallpaper, so that now both displays were showing half of the image on the primary display and half of the new image I was trying to set up on the secondary display.  Weird (and annoying)!

I can try to take some screen shots and e-mail them if you&#39;ld like....
