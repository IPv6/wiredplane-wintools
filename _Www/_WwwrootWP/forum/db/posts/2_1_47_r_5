Just example: I have a lot (so, it&#39;s 5 :-) ) similar applications. I want to assign them to the hotkeys Win+1 , Win+2 , Win+3  and so on.
Now I do it the following way: 
- create the first hotkey (Win+1)
- save configuration to XML-file
- edit the result XML fle manually, copying first hotkey four times
- load configuration from XML to WK
- make additional changes (if any)

All this long running process could be replaced by &#34;Copy hotkey&#34; operation

[quote]About special christmass edition - it`s nice idea :) we can add support for special &#34;XMass&#34; and &#34;Holidays&#34; buttons on thouse keyboards that support them...

Well, usually &#34;X-Mass version&#34; means &#34;Special discount&#34; ;-)
But it could be, of course, some hidden trick (&#39;Easter egg&#39;)";
