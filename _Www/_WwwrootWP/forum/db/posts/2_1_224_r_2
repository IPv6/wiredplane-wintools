Nice work, thank you.

Still would very much like to have the ability to place the menu in a static place. As it stands, menu creation where the mouse is is weird to me, because I rarely know where the mouse cursor actually is! If the process list was *always* centered or cornered at pixel (0,0) that consistency would be very nice.
