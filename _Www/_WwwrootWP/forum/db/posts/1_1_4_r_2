[quote] We will add some missed features to this forum [/quote] in your oh so copious spare time.  :)

As long as I&#39;m making [glowred] requests [/glowred] ( :&#62; )

- The post icon should be displayed on the thread page as well as the forum page.  

- A review (prior to post) function would be handy 

- I don&#39;t remember seeing an automatic &#34;edit&#34; date-time-stamp in addition to the original date-time-stamp.  (It might be there.  I&#39;ll find out as soon as I look elsewhere.)

Nope.  Not there.  Just a latest post date-time-stamp.  I haven&#39;t experimented enough to know whether the edit stamp or the original stamp is used for sorting the thread.

- A bullet list icon or other list support would be handy.

- Quote button should put quote a) at the edit cursor and b) enclose clipboard text.  So should GlowRed, etc.

- An easy way to see all my recent posts and the threaded replies, especially the new ones.  (Again, this may already be there.  I haven&#39;t used help yet.)

- Some resizing of the layout to use the available space.  This could be as simple as a few standard sizes.  When I maximize the window (1024x768), about 1/2 of area is wasted.  Granted, Mozilla Firefox toolbars, titlebar, and footer take 5 lines, but 4 lines for smilies (given empty borders, especially on right)?  My MyIE2 layout is about the same.  Perhaps the WP Labs banner could be vertically compressed?

- I don&#39;t see an easy way to reply to a PM, much less to quote from one while in the midst of writing one.

- I also don&#39;t see a record of PMs sent.

[glowred]Bug[/glowred] - At least one icon label (tooltip) is mixed up (i.e., sunglass icon has &#34;unhappy&#34; tooltip).  Basic smiley ( :) ) doesn&#39;t have a tooltip.

Bug - GlowRed does not appear to work.  Perhaps my local settings are at fault.

EDITED - several times to add new enhancements and a bug. ";
