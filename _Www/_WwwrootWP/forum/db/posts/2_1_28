I want to recommend WK to a friend for a couple of specific features but I want to be sure I understand what is in the various versions.

Lite - WK 1.9.9
v1.9.9 has early versions of a few plug-ins.  Are these disabled?

Trial - WK 2.6.x 
100% of functionality for 15 days. (I don&#39;t see trial duration listed on site but Version History, 2.0 has it.)

Unregistered (Expired Trial)  - WK 2.6.x
Stops working?  Numerous features disabled but still 2.6.x?  Just plug-ins disabled?  (Version History, 2.0 says just plug-ins are diabled but that was some time ago.)

Just what is included in &#34;disabled plug-ins&#34; in this context beyond the downloadable and user-written ones?  E.g., are macros disabled?  

Recommendation
Given that WK 2.6.x is (presumably :D) more stable, would he be better off using the current (and future?) unregistered version rather than v1.9.9 assuming the several initial &#34;key&#34; features are in both (i.e., basic hotkeys - single Ctrl/Shift/Alt + char; improved Window controls - to tray, roll-up, add&#39;l menu; basic quick-run menu; simple scripting)?

Keep up the good work but remember to smell the flowers while they are blooming.  ;)

Thanks,
