$psubject="Printing To Dos";
$pcontent="I&#39;m a new user.  I do like the program but have not figured out how to print a To Do.  I see how to print a note but not a To Do.  I know I can generate a report that includes my To Do but it also includes other things, like my Notes - and I don&#39;t see how I can keep my notes from being included in the reports.  This seems to be a clever program so it seems strange to me that it would be so difficult to print from it.";
