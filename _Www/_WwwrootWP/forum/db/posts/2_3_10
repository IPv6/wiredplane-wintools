$pcontent="First of all, great program :-)
it does almost everything I would like it to but I have a couple of suggestions:
1) When I type the note I would like to use the x button to hide it (or is there a chance to make it configurable?)
2) I&#39;d like to have a calendar view. The same widget (?) you find in the reminder would be great so I can quickly view the calendar and maybe look at the other months. It would be nice to see the days with appointments or maybe double click on a day to be able to add/delete a reminder
Thanks again for this great program
