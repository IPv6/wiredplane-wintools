$pcontent="is it possible to have a hotkey act only if pressed once and ignored if the same hotkey is used with a double press? here&#39;s what i&#39;m trying to do-
 
i have Unpress-Ctrl-Alt-h open the &#39;Map Network Drive&#39; dialogue, and Ctrl-Alt-h-2x open the &#39;Disconnect Network Drive&#39; dialogue. works fine, but unfortunately Ctrl-Alt-h-2x opens both dialogues instead of just the one. possible to ignore the first on 2x press? TIA. ";
