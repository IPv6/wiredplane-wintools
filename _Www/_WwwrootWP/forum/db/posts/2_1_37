$pcontent="Hello,

I use since long time one small utility, that adds &#39;List of Recent files&#39; and &#39;List of Recent folders&#39; into the every &#34;Save as/Open&#34; dialog window.

It&#39;s very conveniant - especially for the old Windows version. 

Unfortunatelly, this utility is quite old and absolutely not configurable. 

Is it possible to include such functionality into WiredKeys? It could be really great!";
