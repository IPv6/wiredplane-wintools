$pcontent="I may be stupid, but I can&#39;t figure out how to do the following;- 
I don&#39;t use Windows Explorer but much prefer Explorer2-I love using Hot keys for lauching EVERYTHING. How can I STOP the default explorer hot keys but still use the same combinations ?
For example. I want to use Windows Key + Y for Yahoo, but I get My Docs first. I want to be able to remove the default My Docs from this Hot key, so I can use it for other things. The same with Win + C, don&#39;t use the calculator. Thanks for any help. Ian Island of Malta.";
