1. Floater Option 
Instead of relying on tray menu icon, (optionally) use an always on top floater (or equivalent).  This floater should always be at the top of the stack. 

Moving the floater should not be a recorded action or, at least, it should be annotated in the script.

2. Pause / Continue Recording 
Floater (and tray) should contain a toggle entry - Pause / Continue Recording; and an entry - Finished Recording. 

3. Add Comment 
Floater (and tray) should contain an entry, Add Comment, that allows the recorder to enter a comment.  I may want to define a rather complex macro which will require further editing and is logically divided into several sections.  

As usual, thanks for your quick response and open mind.

Edit - typo and thanks";
