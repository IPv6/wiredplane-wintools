$rcontent="Thx for the info.

From what I understand this will filter by folder name.

But I have multiple &#34;trees&#34; with folders with the same name (&#34;Mailbox - Barizien, Stephane&#34; and &#34;Personal Folders&#34; at the very least; I might add some &#34;shared folders&#34; in the futurer) so I would like to filter by &#34;folder path&#34; - for instance, to search only the Inbox folder under &#34;Personal Folders&#34;...

Any clue on where to modify the code would help.

BTW, I cannot find the installation instrux on sf.net...
