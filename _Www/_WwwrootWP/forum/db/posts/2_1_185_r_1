You can create macro that will analize active application and do one of the following things
if(&#34;%E_ACTIVEAPP&#34;==&#34;notepad.exe&#34;){
SendKeys(...);
}else{
WireKeys.Paste(selectedText);
}
and assign Ctrl-C on it. it will work as you want but with some exceptions - paste can paste text only currently :( we can add another command for pasting true clipboard content to the next version, if you what this.
Look at the example of E_ACTIVEAPP in help (macro section)
or i can create such macro for you :)

but may be there can be easier solution, we will search for it.
