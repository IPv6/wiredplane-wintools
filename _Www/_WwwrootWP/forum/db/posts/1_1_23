$pcontent="Just wanna know whether someone&#39;s already looked into this bug.

When my email client sends a message To: x Cc: y Bcc: z this is actually two SMTP transactions:

#1
SMTP recipients = x y
Headers:
To: x
Cc: y

#2
SMTP recipients = z
Headers:
To: x
Cc: y
Bcc: z

The problem is that on the second transaction, MAPI2POP3 causes the message to be delivered to x+y+z, not to z only.

I&#39;ll look into the code to fix this myself, but with little help from my friends ;-) would speed my up...

TIA
