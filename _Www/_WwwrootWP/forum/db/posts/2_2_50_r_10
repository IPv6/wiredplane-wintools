$rcontent="Hello!

We recently updated WC with new improvements in multi-monitor environment
1) fixed screensaver: now it works on different monitors with different aspect ratios
2) fixed wallpaper generation routine, now it supports monitors with different aspect ratios.

As before, the second needs to be checked... but about the first we are pretty sure already";
