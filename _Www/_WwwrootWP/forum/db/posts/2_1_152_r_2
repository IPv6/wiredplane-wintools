$rcontent="Thank you, :) and a Happy New Year to you, too.

Most interesting. I&#39;m suprised MS couldn&#39;t have allowed the option with all the money they spend on developmenet. Fortunately, WireKeys uses only about 15MB in my RAM, so I should be fine with running it in the &#34;background.&#34; It is definitely a useful little program, and seems to be quite powerful, too.

In exploring its options, I&#39;ve now spawned a new question. Is there any way to access the path of the currently selected file? For example, what I&#39;d love to do is configure a hotkey to run a program with a parameter including a file or list of files currently selected in the active folder on Windows Explorer. This would allow something similar to creating my own Rclick-Context-Menus by allowing certain commands to be performed on a file.

Anyway, if this is possible, please let me know. :) Thank you,
