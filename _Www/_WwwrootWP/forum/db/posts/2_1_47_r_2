$rcontent="Thanks for informative reply. I will make a list of things I couldn&#39;t find over weekend and re-post. 
Maily, for me it would help if the help Section was divided more clearly into, for example, BASIC OPERATIONS ;-Hot keys-with a couple of simple examples, etc. Then perhaps an ADVANCED section, because for the less experienced the help section seems a bit frightening. 
When I first tried WK I found the drop-down menu a bit difficult to navigate as it took me ages to find various actions. 
I still don&#39;t quite see the difference when creating a hot key, between &#34;Add new File Iem/Folder Item/Application Item&#34; as they all seem to work equally well for the same thing ? Anyway the Programm works very well so this is not really a criticism-more a learning curve from WK !! Thanks again. Ian.";
