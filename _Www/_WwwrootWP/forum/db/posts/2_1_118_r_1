$rcontent="Q: Can you tell me how to set up a key combination that will put a laptop PC into stand by mode?

A: Create new application macro. 
- Set &#34;application path&#34; to 
rundll32.exe
- Set &#34;Parameters&#34; to
powrprof.dll, SetSuspendState

Assign hotkey and that is all %)

Another way is to Define hotkey for quick shutdown and set shutdown type to suspend - this is what stand by on laptops is.
