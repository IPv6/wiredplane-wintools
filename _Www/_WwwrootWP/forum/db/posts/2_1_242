$psubject="Hotkey to unhide specific app?";
$pcontent="I would like to replace my existing hotkey application program with WireKeys, as it can do so much more. But I need to find a way to set a hotkey to control a specific desktop program.

Ideally, I would like to set a hotkey that would minimize one specific program to the tasktray, and then pressing that same hotkey would then unhide just that same application.

Failing that, I could use the global hide to tasktray for active window. But I would need to have a hotkey that would unhide a specific application, not all of them or one at a time.

Thanks for any help you can provide.";
