$rcontent="Yes, it is possible. To do so Just create folder called &#34;Profile&#34; in the WK application folder (where wirekeys.exe is located). Then copy whole directory from this place:
&#34;c:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;&#60;user name&#62;&#92;Application Data&#92;WireKeys&#34;
into this newly created &#34;Profile&#34; folder. If WK sees this folder (with name &#34;Profile&#34; inside installation directory), it will use it for saving all data. Copy folder &#34;WireKeys&#34; (with WireKeys.exe in it and all other files and subfolders including plugins you need) on the stick and that is all!

But note that you can not enable &#34;run with windows&#34; option in this case: at startup your drive (with WK inside it) may not be visible yet. But this is depends on the flash type you are using.";
