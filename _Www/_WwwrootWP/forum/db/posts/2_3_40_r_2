two more ideas..

on Organizer view, I am not sure how the reminders are listed (is it sorted alphabetically): it would be nice to be able to sort by different option.. ie; by Actuation date.

if I have Organizer default action set to &#34;New reminder&#34; clicking the tray icon pops-up two reminder window, and are saved even if I click Cancel. Should it not save only on &#34;OK&#34;?

regards
