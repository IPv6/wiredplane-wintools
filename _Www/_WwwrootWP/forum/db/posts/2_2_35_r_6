http://www.wiredplane.com/download/wirechanger_beta.zip

Most of the features allows one to control desktop more conviniently. New template added - minilendar - something similar to calendars from other calendar-related applications, but with all interactivity supported by WireChanger. Greatly expanded Elefun`s walppapers support (install any of thier wallpapers first and then run WC3 to handle them with notes and calendars over animations)
