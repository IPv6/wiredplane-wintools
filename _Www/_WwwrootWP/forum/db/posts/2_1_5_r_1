$rcontent="For Resizer, please explain what is being resized.  
- Is the entire window and various fields be proportionally resized?  
- Is the resize property being turned on?

As an experiment, try it on TinySpell spell check window
     www.numerit.com

When displaying the resizer lines, could the &#34;inner rectangle&#34; be outlined more explicitly without overly burdening the system?

BTW, thanks for adding this plug-in.  I hope others also find it useful.
