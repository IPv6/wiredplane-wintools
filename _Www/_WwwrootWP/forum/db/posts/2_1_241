$pcontent="Hello there --

I have been a long time user of Wire Keys.  However, our company just recently changed personal firewall/av software from ZoneAlarm to eEye Blink and now my WireKeys won&#39;t start up at all.  And a number of times that I&#39;ve tried to reinstall the software, it just crashes the entire system...

Would you be able to give some advice?  Thank you.
