$pcontent="My calendar keeps disappearing.  I have to go back into my settings and redo them to get it back.  Since the calendar is the only reason I wanted this program in the first place, I really want it to come up every time I start my computer.  Is there any way to fix this?

Thanks
Peg

PS  Today after I went through the settings again, all I got was the note I asked how to delete in my last question.  I can&#39;t seem to get my calendar back.  :sad1 ";
