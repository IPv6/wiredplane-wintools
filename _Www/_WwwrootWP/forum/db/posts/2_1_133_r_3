$rcontent="Thank you for response!
I mean, there is a line in folder context menu, &#34;Play In Winamp&#34; and that line doesnt have hotkey normally. I would like to have a hotkey to that line (command) :) In my case &#34;Play In Winamp&#34; is 9th line in context menu, for others it will be different, depends how crowded folders context menu has become because of various installed programs.
So, should i get this your program and start to learn macros? I just wanted to know, is my goal realistic at all ;) Of course, ready made solutions would be very welcome and appreciated ;)

Thank you!";
