$pcontent="BUG - Snap to windows and to screen edge does not work.  I noticed this a few weeks ago, but forgot to report it.  I have used it intermittently in the past.

I have tried setting both snap options off and then on and on separately; re-enabling the plug-in;; and different snap distances -- but not all combinations of the above.  Forcing window inside screen boundries did work in v2.7 and earlier releases.

Present in WireKeys v2.7 on Win2k.  
Previously noticed in v2.6.x or perhaps v2.5.5.

ENHANCEMENT - Add About item to WK Preferences menu somewhere.";
