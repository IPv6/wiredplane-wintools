$rcontent="OK, did all this, and also watched the registry in the process.

Initial state: nVidia Desktop Manager configured to use same background for both displays.

1) Closed Wirechanger.
2) Set desktop background to &#34;Stonehenge&#34;.
3) Looked in registry at HKEY_CURRENT_USER&#92;Control Panel&#92;Desktop.  Entries of interest are:
   ConvertedWallpaper = &#34;C:&#92;Windows&#92;Web&#92;Wallpaper&#92;Stonehenge.jpg&#34;
   OriginalWallpaper = &#34;C:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;Jonathan&#92;Local Settings&#92;Application Data&#92;Microsoft&#92;Wallpaper1.bmp&#34;
   Wallpaper = same as OriginalWallpaper

4) Set nView Desktop Manager to &#34;Allow different backgrounds per display&#34;; set second background to a different image, centered.

5) Checked Display Properties.  Current desktop background now reads as &#34;PerMonitorWallpaper0&#34;.

6) Checked Registry.  &#34;ConvertedWallpaper&#34; and &#34;OriginalWallpaper&#34; are the same, but &#34;Wallpaper&#34; is now &#34;C:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;Jonathan&#92;Application Data&#92;nView_Wallpaper&#92;PerMonitorWallpaper0.bmp&#34;.  No other entries (such as WallpaperOrigin) changed.

7) Looked at that BMP file.  It is a 2880x1200 image, with the 1600x1200 image for primary display at left, and the 1280x720 image for the secondary display at right (with a black box in the lower-right 1280x480 portion).  Interesting that the second image is on the right, even though the display is configured as being on the left.

8) Zipped up PerMonitorWallpaper0.bmp (with directory info), and will e-mail it in just a minute (watch out, it&#39;s 3.3MB!)....

I think that should be enough info to get it working!  Of course, it&#39;s possible ATI does things differently....
