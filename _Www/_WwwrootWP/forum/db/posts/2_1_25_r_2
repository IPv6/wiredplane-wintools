The only question - are you sure that simplified chinese is not demand full UniCode support? maybe we have to add Unicode compatibility somewhere? anyway, if you will encounter such incompatibilities - let us know, we will improve everything is needed :)

P.S. latest version is 2.3.6.1, so can you start with it, not with 2.3.6?

Anyway, thank you again :)";
