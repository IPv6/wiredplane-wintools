$rcontent="[quote]:( WK is stalled but this is not a death :) There is simply not much useful changes to make a new update (i don`t whant to issue update without any real value) still... quote]

I accept your point of releasing strategy.

But I don&#39;t agree, that an update isn&#39;t worth. 
Here a few meaningful points:  :bulb
-- How to show a hidden app via hotkey?
-- Action when closing WirkeKeys
-- Shell Extender Favorite Folder Error
-- Scheduler and reminders
-- Autotext plugin more expand keys

That were only MY suggustions in the past; see forum.
(The russian text is not fully understandable to me :-(

Awaiting the new WK.  :thmbup

Richy.

BTW: The good news is: the emailer is working now, when someting is posted.
