$pcontent="When I sent a message to a group, some get them, but some not. The program only display a message &#34;you message has not been sent. Do you wish to resend message after a while&#34; . This message does not display the name list who did not get the message. If there any functions that I can check it out?
Besides, if I choose to resend later, it will send to all the persons again, those who has received the message before will get it again. How can I solve this problem?
