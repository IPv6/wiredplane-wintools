A couple of observations:

1) If I have the secondary monitor configured on the right when I start WC, everything works correctly, even if I then switch the monitor back to the left (without restarting WC, of course).

2) I noticed that the special image modifiers (Kaleidoscope, Image Mosaic, etc.) are only applied to the image for the primary screen.

3) Would it be possible to generate different images for each display?  (OK, that was a question, not an observation!   :P)  Perhaps provide an option in the preferences to either generate the same image or different images per display? ";
