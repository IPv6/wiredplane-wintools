$rcontent=" OK, my system has a lot of inconsistencies (this is for sure), however, I could reproduce the problem on (at least) 3 machines. As far as this bug reappear on every lnk-file, and as far as the old version didn&#39;t have this strange behaviour, I believe, it&#39;s the problem of WireKeys.
 
 Could it be caused by non-English Windows installation? (I have German one)

 Could You please also check the &#34;key-up&#34; processing: sometimes if I hold the key from keyboard combination for 1-2 seconds and then release it, the WireKey just disappear... :-(

Steps to reproduce:
 - make a link to any program (i.e. Notepad)
 - Create the combination with &#34;Win&#34; key (i.e. Win+Q) and assign it to this link.
 - Press Win
 - Wait a second
 - Press Q
 - Release both Win and Q at the same time
 - WireKey disappears (it&#39;s not always so)";
