$pcontent="I want to show an app window (that&#39;s hidden) by using a hotkey.

Reason:
I autohide some unwished app windows by means of WireKeys.
When I want to use this app, I have to do some mouseclicks laboriously.

Looking for a way to associate the show of this ONE app via hotkey.

Is this possible?
