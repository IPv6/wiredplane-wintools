No, not necessary.
The background is, that sometimes I work at a customer.
I&#39;m working there with WK running from stick.
When I leave at evening I close WK (via systray).
Then I went home and will notice having forgotten my stick.
Therefore I want a reminder initiated by WK when about to close.

Could it be done?";
