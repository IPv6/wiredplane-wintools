$pcontent="If I create a reminder that will be activated to pop up at a time when my computer is turned off that reminder will not pop  up the next time my computer turned is on.

Example:  Reminder set to display on January 10.  Computer not turned on until January 12. - Reminder does not pop up.

How do I set WireNote to have the reminder pop?

If WireNote will pop up as above, it will be a very useful program.

Thank you.";
