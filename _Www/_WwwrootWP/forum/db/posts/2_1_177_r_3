$rcontent="OK - disabled macros and reinstalled this time no problem.
Autotext is still running (but the &#39;followed by space&#39; feature does not work nor has in the last two of your updates)
Mouse gestures is running (although I have never used it nor know what it does)
Macro recorder is now off
Shell extender is now off
Windows helper is now off
WinLIRC Remote Controls is now off

When I can risk it I will try switching them on one by one and let you know. But right now I have a big job on that I rely on Autotext to help write code. Can you mend the &#39;after space&#39; feature? It was very useful.";
