$psubject="Immobilisation of Windows Keys";
$pcontent="Running Windows 2000Pro with 6 partitions. 
Nearly always get the &#34;MS-generated-Windows-menu&#34; popping up when using left or right Windows keys in my hotkeys. When using the &#34;Apps&#34; key as double keypress ALWAYS get the &#34;Windows Apps&#34; menu popping up then too. 

I still get the Programs to open that have the configured hot keys, but it is getting to be a pain to click the extra time on the tskbar to make the Windows menu disappear again. Naturally I have all the various things ticked in PREFERENCES to override the Windows keys. Is this something we just have to live with or is there a 100% way to kill the default Windows Keys once and for all? Thanks for any help. Ian.";
