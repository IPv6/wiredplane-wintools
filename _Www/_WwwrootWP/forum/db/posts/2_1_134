$psubject="Strange code in my keyboard capture";
$pcontent="I am evaluating purchasing wirekeys, but I have a question regarding one of the problems I&#39;ve run into.  I am using it today and one of the key-combinations that I had set up, Caps-L, stopped working.  I tried resetting the key, and when I typed Caps-L, it came up as &#34;Caps Lock-L-@AN&#34; -- I&#39;m not sure what the @AN is, I haven&#39;t been able to find any documentation on it.  Any helP?

thanks!
Eric
