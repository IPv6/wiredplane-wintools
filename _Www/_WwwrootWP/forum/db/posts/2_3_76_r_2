$rcontent="Hi there, thanks for your fast reply.

I&#39;m sorry, but I still don&#39;t understand it.

I see settings for a specific day/month/year, and for every day/month/year, and for &#34;every xxxxday&#34; on the right.

But if I choose, for example &#34;every Tuesday&#34;, wouldn&#39;t I get reminded every week then?

I need to be reminded once a month, on the first Tuesday (only). How do I do that?";
