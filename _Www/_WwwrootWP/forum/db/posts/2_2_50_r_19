It seems that we done with it. But MS has  very interesting (not to say strange) approach for mapping wallpaper on multiple monitors. Can you re-download WireChanger again? Now it should be fine. The only case when WC can act strangely again - when second monitor is above primary one. Can you test this situation on latest WireChanger build when you will have spare time?
About different images - we will add this later (Step by step approach ^)
