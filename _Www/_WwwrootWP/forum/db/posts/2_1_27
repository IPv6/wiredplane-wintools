$pcontent="i find several bugs in wirekeys 2.6.3.1, described below.


bug no.1

1st time: quick-run popup items (right-click) -&#62; detach item into icon (item becomes a tray icon) -&#62; detach from tray (item becomes a floater) -&#62; close floater

2nd time: quick-run popup items (right-click on the same item) -&#62; detach item into icon (bug: item becomes a floater!)


bug no.2

any asian character filled in the [b]parameter[/b] field becomes an empty string when referenced in macro files. as a result, asian language file names are not supported in [b]append to diary[/b] macro (also [b]keylogger[/b] plugin), unless they&#39;re directly inserted into the macro file instead of filled in the parameter field.


here is a little suggestion...

i think it&#39;s a good idea to add a new pattern which provides a utf-8 output of the selected text. many asian search engines, including google china & google japan, are using utf-8 format for asian chars in urls. the %ESCAPED pattern in wirekeys only provides utf-16 output. as far as i know, the utf-8 output can only be made using encodeURIComponent( ) function in macros. so i have to write a new [b]search google[/b] macro in order to make it working in chinese environment. if there&#39;s a pattern somewhat like %UTF8, everything will be much simpler. :)";
