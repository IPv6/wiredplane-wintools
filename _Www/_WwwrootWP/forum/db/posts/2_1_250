$pcontent="wirekeys infected by Trojan horse Generic5.ZXV, anybody with the same experience?

virus identified by avg 7.5 antivirus free edition with latest antivirus definitions today...
funny thing is that i installed wirekeys as a gaotd, and avg 7.5 free antivirus did not consider it a threat then...

bitdefende 8 free edition, ms windows defender and avg antispyware  ignored it...

yahooed and googled the virus with no info results...

i think this is a false positive...";
