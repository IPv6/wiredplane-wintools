WireKeys 2.3 and WireChanger 2.3 were released. Plans for future for WireChanger: very impressive 3D animations right over desktop, greatly improved perfomance and memory footprint, all templates will be interactive (for example double clicking weather forecast will direct you to corresponding site, double clicking calendar cell will popup note for that day and so on). Additional thanks to Julia FAST for interesting suggestions!

WireKeys 1.9.5 released. Fixed some bugs and added 2 new plugins:
- Desktop icons font master. This plugin allows to set font and color of the desktop icons. Full source code included (see &#34;Plugins&#34; help page). Plugin disabled by default, you can enable it in preferences
- WireKeys windows traits. This plugin makes all windows in your system sticky and allows you to hide windows to tray by right-clicking its minimize button. &#39;Sticky&#39; mean that window will be automatically snapped to other windows edges and screen boundaries when moved. Stickness can be temporaly disabled by holding Shift key while moving window. Other plugin features: ability to force all windows to be inside screen boundaries (so you will never cry on window with its title bar placed beyond monitor edge ;), ability to define windows to be settled in tray instead of taskbar (such windows will be automatically moved to tray on focus blur). This plugin is disabled by default also, you can enable it in preferences
