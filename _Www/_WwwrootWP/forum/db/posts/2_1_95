$pcontent="I may be missing something here, but I noticed that Wire Keys saves me loads of mouse movements etc.

However, after finishing with a window in, for example, a multi-tab browser, it is a fiddle to have to mouse click on every window to close it. Even more so if I have 4 windows of Excel/Word open, I was wondering if there is a way to create a hot key to close the active window instead of searching for that tiny &#34;X&#34; with the mouse/ Sorry if it already exists, but I searched in the Help/Index already! Thanks. Ian.";
