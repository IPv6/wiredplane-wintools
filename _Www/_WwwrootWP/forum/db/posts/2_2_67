$pcontent="I&#39;m probably missing something very obvious here, but can&#39;t for the life of me see what it is.

I created a note by double clicking on my calendar.  I set it to repeat each year on May 28th.  I now have a note on top of my calendar with a smily face  on the corner that I can&#39;t move or delete.  How can I get rid of this?

Thanks";
