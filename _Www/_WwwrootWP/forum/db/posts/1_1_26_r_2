I can supply you [how? this forum doesn&#39;t support attachments AFAIK] with a zipfile showing .MSG files saved at recipients affected by the problem and at recipients NOT affected by the problem (for the very same original message).

I am willing to try and fix the bug myself, but I need some clues.

How can something at the recipient side be different that will cause such a conversion? Can it be at the server side (something with the configuration of their mailboxes?)

I&#39;m not sure what the version of our Exchange server is.

On the SMTP side of things, it outputs the following banner:

Microsoft ESMTP MAIL Service, Version: 6.0.3790.1830

I&#39;ll ask the IT folks for more info.
