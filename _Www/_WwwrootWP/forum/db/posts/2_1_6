$pcontent="It would be great if we could personalize this display as in some other programs that offer this kind of functionality. We could enter a string corresponding to the time and date display we wanted. Time should be available as 12 or 24 hour display.

Here are directions for how to format a date in another program I use:

-----------------------
d      Day of month as digits with no leading zero for single-digit days.

dd     Day of month as digits with leading zero for single-digit days.

ddd    Day of week as a three-letter abbreviation.

dddd   Day of week as its full name.

M      Month as digits with no leading zero for single-digit months.

MM     Month as digits with leading zero for single-digit months.

MMM    Month as a three-letter abbreviation.

MMMM   Month as its full name.

y      Year as last two digits, but with no leading zero for years less than 10.

yy     Year as last two digits, but with leading zero for years less than 10.

yyyy   Year represented by full four digits.

gg     Period/era string. This element is ignored if the date to be formatted does not have an associated era or period string.


For example, to get the date string
Wed, Aug 31 94

use the following picture string:
ddd, MMM dd yy
