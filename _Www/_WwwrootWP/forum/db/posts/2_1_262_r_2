$rcontent="Very minimized means, I have the Winamp-GUI as a very (!) small floater at top of my desktop. I think 2 mm hight.

The problem is, that I cannot SEE the title playing now.
I have to point to the little pixel that stands for playlist. Then look for the running title.

When Winamp starts a new title I see the name in the OSD.
That&#39;s fine.

But I want to see the just running title.
It&#39;s enough it would appear for let&#39;s say 4 seconds after pressing a hotkey.

Hmh, I understand what I mean... ;-)
