Now you can download new update to WK and download special macro from our site (&#39;Macros&#39; page) to control window size and position.
Macro can move window left/right/top/bottom at 2 speeds and send widnow to corresponding screen edge as well - all-in-one place

Window moving works very well. Thank you. Is is possible to allow keys to interact? ie. Ctrl-Alt-NumPad5 moves window up, Ctrl-Alt-NumPad1 moves window left, Ctrl-Alt-NumPad5+NumPad1 moves window diagonally up-left.

How does one control the window size?

New macro to support quick switching between modes in Explorer and new plugin that can switch mode and adds history of used folders to Open/Save dialogs
[/quote]

Quick switching mode works very well so far. 
History plugin is very *very* cool. Would it be possible to add more Favourite spots? Does &#39;Switch Explorer into view&#39; in this plugin duplicate what the quick switching macro does?
