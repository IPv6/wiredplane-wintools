Hi
I think it is possibel develop your program to a killer appz
by changing a bit in the code.
I have exspeimented a year with url links and how to make it.
1. add to your program import of urls from asci.txt files
not only one link.
2. add import av htm table to visulaise jpg, sound and more
3. Add exsport of settings not only as wallpaper but as htm

Now you got an url visualisation tool
Relise it as Freeware to make it change the whole internet

I have been developing this for over a year andthis is a bit of it.
Whats your comments to go futher in development.

2MCA: Yes, of course, if you have time and want to help us in localization process - we will be happy to give you a life registration key :)
About conflicts. If you are using Windows 98/Windows ME, just download updated installation packages. We have just fixed major incompatibility issue with Win98/ME GDI resource leak :(

Hi there.

Amazingly great programs your Wirekeys and WireNotes. It&#39;s a pity Wirekeys is still a very conflicting app... however... As it seems or as far as i have noted, it conflicts and interferes with almost any other program. 

I am going to give a try to your WireChange. Apparently, it seems to be another great program also. How about having it translated into Brazilian Portuguese in exchange for a life registration key? Please, let me know about this.

Regards.

Dear Sirs:

Well, I&#39;ve another - how about a second (or third) &#34;boss key&#34;?

I&#39;m using your present bosskey to -hide- some DOS windows that bring up communications tunnels, plus any other apps that need hiding. 

If I had a second bosskey, I&#39;d put in all of the windows that I want to &#34;hide to tray&#34;.

Third bosskey would &#34;terminate&#34; all of the apps that need instant termination:-)
