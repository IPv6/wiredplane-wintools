$psubject="Wirekeys problem with Outlook Attachments";
$pcontent="
Whenever I try to put an attachment on an email in Outlook by right-clicking the file and using the send to mail recipient option, the email &#34;send&#34; button is disabled on my email.  

So for example:

I open windows explorer and navigate to the file I want to send.
Right-click the file and choose: send to - mail recipient
A blank email opens with that file attached.  I enter an email address, subject and body text.
I click &#34;send&#34; and nothing happens.
I close wirekeys and click &#34;send&#34; and it works.

I can send email attachments if I don&#39;t use that option to attach them.  i.e. I have to use the little paper-clip icon in Outlook to add the attachment to the email.

By far, I use the &#34;send to mail recipient&#34; option.

Anybody ever seen/heard of this before?

Windows XP Pro / Outlook 2000
