$pcontent="Hi,

This has bothered me for a while but I&#39;m finally posting about it...

Whenever I want to optimize memory, and it is the first time since starting Windows, I have to use the Wirekeys menu - my keyboard shortcut doesn&#39;t work. After doing it once from the menu, though, I can use the keyboard shortcut as much as I want until I restart Windows.

Hope you understand...";
