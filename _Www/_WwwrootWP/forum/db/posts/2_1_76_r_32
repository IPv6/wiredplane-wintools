- New features in Autotext plugin: 1) If you set &#34;Text insertion method&#34; in plugin preferences to &#34;SendKeys&#34;, you will be able to use special markers in replacement string (like {LEFT}{HOME}, etc), which will change cursor position or fire control/alt key combinations; 2) In &#34;Execute&#34; replcement item, you can now execute macro instead of starting application. Just start replcement string with &#34;javascript:&#34; text (similar to in-place macro of quick-run items)
- Added new plugin: Post-it notes. It will allow you to create and manage feature-reach post-it notes (similar to post-it notes of WireNote application)
- New script methods: GetForegroundWindow,SetWindowPosition,SetWindowSize&#60;br&#62;
- Additional feature added to &#34;Run as from command line&#34; action.
