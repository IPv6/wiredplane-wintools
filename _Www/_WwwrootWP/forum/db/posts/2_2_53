$psubject="Feature requests for WireChanger";
$pcontent="OK, now that we&#39;ve got the widescreen & dual display features sorted out  :glad, I have a few requests for further features, if you feel so inclined ;):

1) With dual monitors, allow each screen to have a separate image, preferably as an option that can be turned on or off (yes, I already mentioned this in the other thread)

2) I&#39;d like a widget that displays the image&#39;s filename (either just the name or the complete path)

3) I would like presets to also save the state of the themes as well as the widgets.  For example, I would like to be able to have 2 presets which enable different themes (or just use different weights for them).  This is somewhat related to hiclass&#39; request, I think.

WireChanger is a great program, and I&#39;m amazed at how responsive you&#39;ve been to my requests so far.  I recommend it to everyone!  :thmbup";
