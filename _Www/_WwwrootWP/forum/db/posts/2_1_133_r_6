$rcontent="WiredPlane, that script is great. After changing the program path it works perfectly. I was curious if the ability exists to perform such a task on multiple files, though. I have a variety of other programs that I&#39;d like to hotkey to accept multiple files, including, WinAmp of course. My reply in my recent post on top of the forum reflects that (&#34;New. Hotkeys without running WireKeys?&#34;).

If the above is not possible, perhaps there is a method to avoid the errors caused when trying to open multiple files using this macro?

If you could provide assistance with such a task I would be most appreciative. :) Thank you,
