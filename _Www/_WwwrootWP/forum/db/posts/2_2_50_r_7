$rcontent="If it&#39;s ready by noon, Mountain time (GMT -7:00), I should be able to give it a quick test.  Otherwise, I probably won&#39;t have time until Wednesday, most likely.

Regarding the Preset option for the screensaver:  I had it set to &#34;Default&#34;, and my default options don&#39;t include the Minilender (and can&#39;t include the Date/Time stamp!).  As an experiment, I created a new preset and turned off all Widgets (and set the screensaver to use the new preset), and it still showed the Date/Time stamp and Minilender.  :?";
