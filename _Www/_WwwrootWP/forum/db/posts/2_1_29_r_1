move any window x number of pixels in any of 8 directions (left/right/up/down/diagonals) without having to use the windows&#39; context menu (Alt-Space-M) and arrow keys.

Well, fine! :) We will publish macro for this task on the website soon! :)

-move any window to one of 10 locations on the screen: center, bottom right, bottom center, bottom left, center left, center right, top left, top center, top right. The software &#39;Freeshade (http://www.hmmn.org/FreeShade/)&#39; does this, and it is very very convenient.
(Freeshade also does something very cool, which is to maximize a window horizontally or vertically only, and not to the entire screen. It&#39;s neat and worth checking out.)

If fact this can be done with current version too.
To send window to the screen edge middle-click or right-click on window border (when cursor changes to the resize arrows)
To maximize window up-down ot left-right double-click right button on the desired edge. if you with to assign hotkeys to that actions - we will add them

The second category is Explorer folder manipulation. The ability to hotkey the following would be super cool:

-Change a folder&#39;s view setting. Ex: Ctrl-Alt-u changes current explorer window to &#39;List&#39; view, Ctrl-Alt-i changes explorer window to &#39;Details&#39; view, etc.

Ok, there will be another macro for it!

-Fully expand the contents of chosen columns in a folder window, and auto-resize the window to fit the expanded columns. Here&#39;s screenshots for what I mean:

Well, nice idea. we will add this too - just have to research the situation

It would also be hugely handy if this could be done with open/save dialogues (there was a piece of software some years ago that did this, but forget the name now), but I am guessing that this adds another level of complexity.
