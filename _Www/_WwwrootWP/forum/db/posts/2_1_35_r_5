$rsubject="RE: optimize memory bug";
$rcontent="sorry, but I still see the same problem. I get the OSD but the memory doesn&#39;t optimize. If I select it from the sirekeys menu right after trying the hotkey, it does optimize. After that, the hotkey works... It&#39;s a tiny problem, but I thought it was a little strange so I should mention it. Also, it would be great to be able to create desktop shortcuts for optimizing memory or displaying the processes list. I think I mentioned it before...";
