2) What double-click you mean (i am not familiar with Mac behaviour : )
If you mean double clicking on any part of the window, you can assign &#34;Double-right click&#34; hotkey to the &#34;Rollup&#34; active window - and that is all :) But may be it is more convinient to use double-middle click, becouse right-click is commonly used to open context menu (and this can`t be blocked at this time)";
