$psubject="New User - Some questions";
$pcontent="Downloaded the software today and it seems it&#39;s a great piece of work. Still some questions:
1. Patterns - can&#39;t find paterns for title. I would like the title to be the first line of note/to-do.
2. It is not clear if it is possible to send messages to other computers on the Internet, knowing their ip address and internal computer name.

Thanks
