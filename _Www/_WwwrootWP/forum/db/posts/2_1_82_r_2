 - incorrect work with &#34;Win&#34; key (see another post in this forum)
We are working on it. Unfortunately there is no really good solution anyway

- insert from Clipboard History doesn&#39;t work in some programs (e.g. in Windows telnet).
Sorry, currently console windows are not supported. This is Windows limitation :(((


- &#34;Explorer plugin&#34; - &#34;Manage folders&#34; : if I try to add folder &#34;C:&#92;TEMP&#34; (without trailing backslash) it adds only &#34;c:&#92;&#34;. For &#34;C:&#92;TEMP&#92;&#34; it works normally.
This is because one can drag and drop files from explorer and there can be file &#34;TEMP&#34; without extension. We will add fix

- &#34;Explorer plugin&#34; - &#34;add To Places&#34; - Displays message &#34;Not enough rights to work with Places&#34;. What does it mean? What are these &#34;places&#34; at all?
This is vertical bar at the left of Save/Load dialogs (with &#34;My documents&#34;, etc folders). Not enough rights means that WK can`t write specail registry information to trick this folders

- &#34;Check for update&#34; menu item doesn&#39;t work (probably, because I&#39;m located behind proxy - there is no seting for proxy in the program)
Currently proxy from explorer used for this conection. Just define right proxy in the Explorer`s settings :)";
