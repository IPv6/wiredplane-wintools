$rcontent="Thanks.. I&#39;m getting the hang of how it works.  

I have another questions.. the weather widget is nice, but when I go to the website that is linked, I cannot find my city.  :(

I&#39;m po-dunk Salt Lake City, Utah.. which is a rather small city, but I&#39;d like to see it appear. Anyway to request a city be added to their service? I really like the weather widget.";
