$rcontent="Hi,

No, I didn&#39;t have &#39;Auto Open Pop Up Window&#39; for Organiser selected, if that&#39;s what you mean. But I can drop files from Explorer to Organizer (what a great feature! I didn&#39;t know you could do this) But I can&#39;t, however, move the link to the file from it&#39;s first position when created in Organizer.";
