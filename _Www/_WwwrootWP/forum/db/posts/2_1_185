For example, I have some macros, that inserts copyright character into the text. I want to assign it to Ctrl+C in Notepad. Of course, I want that all other applications use this hotkey combination as usually (so paste from Clipboard).

Is it possible to do so?

Sorry, could not find this topic in the options or in the help.";
