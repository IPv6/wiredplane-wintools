$rcontent="Set delay to zero. Pressing a letter key autoreduces (where one is defined). Pressing Shift, Control, Alt, and Win changes the title but does not autoreduce the list.

My apologies for not noticing earlier that autoreduce worked for letters but not for control, alt, etc. (My excuse is that I don&#39;t think that way as I would press a modifier key before pressing a letter. I don&#39;t hold letter keys down very often except for spacebar.)

Note, I have Win-R-W defined for Windows Resizer (mnemonic: W-Resize-Window). This is shown (autoreduce) for R but not for W -- nor of course Win.

Thanks for continuing to investigate this.
