$psubject="Empty Bin / Windows key";
$pcontent="Sorry to ask so many questions, 

1) Was using Wonderful Icon before WK, and it has a &#34;Empty Recycle Bin&#34; hot key, is it possible to set this up with WK? 

2)Also, when I use the Windows Keys( L or R) as shortcuts to launch progs, I always get the Start menu popping up too- how do I imobilise that action please? 
3) Have set up Caps Lock to not work except with Shift, I now want to use it as a hot key as well, for launching Apps., is this possible?

May be me being a stupid Englishman, but I find some of the guidance in the help file to be a bit difficult to find, for some topics-however wonderful forum here !

Thanks for help. 

Ian.";
