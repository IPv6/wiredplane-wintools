$rcontent="&#62;&#62;2) I would also like to have a delete option in the menu &#62;&#62;(maybe in the pin menu?)

&#62; 2) It is already here... The last item (Ctrl-D)
Sorry it took so long to reply.
If I change the behavior of the x to hide instead of delete, the delete functionality is no longer accessible with the mouse. I could still open the organizer to delete it but it would be easier if I could use the mouse on the note window :-).
Thanks for your quick reply
Ciao
