can you check - after switching to such pop-under window, will it stay on top when you switch focus to another app?[/quote]

Yes, &#34;About&#34; window stays on top when I switch to another application.

Regarding all other applications, that are opened in the background:
I have the impression (but I&#39;m not sure), that it happens when Windows &#34;Remote Client&#34; standard software is running. Could it change the standard behaviour of the applications?
Is it possible to [b]force[/b] the application to be active in WireKeys?";
