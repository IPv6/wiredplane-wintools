$psubject="My evaluation and suggestion";
$pcontent="I am evaluating the ver 3.4.9 of WireChanger and would like to suggest:

1. I suggest to have calendar settings per wallpaper. i.e. diff calendar settings (color, position, skins) will be used based on the wallpaper being applied.

2. When loading pictures from folder, allows user to decide whether to include sub folder at the same time. Currently, user need to go to preferences-&#62;system options to toggle that

3. Allows sub theme within a theme (for wallpaper), so user can organize wallpapers in a more detail manner.

4. The &#34;scalling&#34; and some widgets like &#34;Exact wallpaper position&#34; should be allowed to work on per wallpaper basic. (instead of per theme only)";
