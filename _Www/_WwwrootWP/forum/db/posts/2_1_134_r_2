$rcontent="The problem is no longer persisting / replicatable.  I closed and restarted wirekeys and it fixed it.

as for the information.

1. The name of the action was: LOG
2. Enable extended hotkey processing is on, yes
3. I tried entering the same hotkey for another action in the same tree (called WORKDAY), it ended up the same way.

For now, the problem is resolved.  Tell me what I should do, should it happen again and I&#39;ll try it next time.

Also -- do you happen to know if there is a way to cause sendKeys, or something else playback-able to press the windows key or the menu (app popup) key?

Thanks,
Eric";
