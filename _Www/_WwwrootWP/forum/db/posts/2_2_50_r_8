Is it possible that you somehow use the old screensaver still?
Can you do the following (2 min max)?
- Find WCSaver.src in Windows folder (in the root or may be in the system32 subfolder)
- Delete file completely (or files if it managed to be copied in different folders)
- open WC preferences, goto the &#34;screensaver&#34; page and click on &#34;install screensaver&#34;. then set preset option to your new preset that you just created

that is all. check screensaver when it will be started by system again";
