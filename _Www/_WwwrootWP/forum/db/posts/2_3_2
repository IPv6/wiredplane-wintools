I use WireNote like a virtual Post-It on my desk. It is very convenient, very easy to use. I use Note with transparency mode, in mini-mode. I also use the reminder with Note, so I dont forget anything anymore!

Congratulation for this splendid Shareware. Much better than any other software.

PS: I found a small bug. I told WirePlane about this issue. In less than 3 days, they &#34;fixit&#34;. Most of the company does not even answer when told them their software gets a bug. And you pay much more for something less efficient.

When I ticked the &#39;autohide&#39; box for messages It stays open but when you place the cursor on the top of message it disappear... (WinXP). I have to restart program to be able to close the window.
The idea is brilliant, but the interface and setting is not user friendly - serious market limitation. I think this program is designed for a PC users, which does always means PC professionals - it should be simple and based on standard interface (especially I want to mention close button. I always trying to close window by pressing upper left corner :-)
There are no indication that you are connected to the network. It will be nice to have the function to scan the LAN to try to find WireNote clients...
Good luck and thank you.
