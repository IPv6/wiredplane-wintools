$rsubject="RE: Strange code in my keyboard capture";
$rcontent="Gotcha.  I&#39;ll try that out.  There are a couple of other things -- first, I&#39;m seeing a lengthy delay sometimes when I trigger a macro for playing with the keyboard.  A small icon (script icon, I think -- small light-green boxes connected to a dark-green one) shows up in my system tray, sometimes for a few seconds, before the macro begins playing.

The second, and I&#39;m not sure how to replicate this, is that I&#39;m seeing spots where the macro will seem to stop playing in the middle of a script.  I will do my best to replicate it so that you can see it.

Finally, worth honorable mention, is an issue I&#39;ve found with the following script.  It should type h, alt-h and then alt-m (try this in notepad.  those function keys don&#39;t do anything important)

function wkMain(selectedText,macroParameter)
{
	var WshShell = new ActiveXObject(&#39;WScript.Shell&#39;);
	WshShell.SendKeys (&#34;h%h%m&#34;);
};

It doesn&#39;t though, on my computer.  it types h0845.  Is there some sort of escaping I need to do?

I guess most of all, I want to make sure that this product is continually in development, being worked on, before I purchase it -- that I can expect that bugs will be fixed where found.

I&#39;d also like to know if feature requests are a possibility down the road.

Also, Is there an email where I can direct further questions of a more individual nature?

Thanks very much!";
