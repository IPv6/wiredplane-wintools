$psubject="Displays too many wallpapers";
$pcontent="Suddenly, WireChanger is not only displaying one image on each monitor, but a third image centered between the two monitors; when they overlap, the regular images are in the foreground and the third is hidden behind them.

I&#39;ve tried shutting down and restarting WireChanger; doing the same while changing the wallpaper to a Windows tiled image in between; and rebooting the computer after shutting down WireChanger and changing to a tiled image.

How can I fix this?

Thanks!";
