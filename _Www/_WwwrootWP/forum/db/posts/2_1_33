$psubject="Preferences - Change Tab Color When Secondary Hotkey Selected, Etc.";
$pcontent="Enhancement Requests

1. When more than one hotkey is specified, change the color of the tab to indicate this.

2. When defining hotkeys, the context menu Add Control does not contain all control keys (i.e., shiftkey when it is enabled).  Note, CapsLock does appear under Keys.

3. Preferences documentation - when using CapsLock as a control key, Shift+CapsLock toggles CapsLock on/off. 

4. Prefs doc - comment for hotkey selection field should remind users:
1. To clear a hotkey assignment, you must first select the field by dbl-clicking and then clear it via the context menu.
b. To leave hotkey assignment field, use Escape or Backspace or select another field with mouse. (??)

5. Odd behavior? & Backspace as Clear
 - Opening the hotkey assignment field and then press Esc.  Nothing happens.  2xEsc does close the field.  Backspace behaves the same way.
 - Escape does not close context menu in hotkey assignment but backspace does.  This may have to do with whether an item on the menu has focus.  
 - With menu open, 2xEsc or 2xBksp exit (but don&#39;t clear).  
 - After making an assignment, 2xEsc or 2xBksp is required to exit.
 - Whatever the assignment (cleared or hotkey), Backspace and Escape leave that value intact.  The only way to clear an existing value or prevent a new assignment is to use the context menu.  (I didn&#39;t test going directly to the Cancel button.)

This may be perfectly valid and normal behavior but it is confusing.  

6. I think being able to use backspace to clear the field is desirable.  The current behavior is strikes me as counterintuitive/inconsistent with normal Windows behavior.

When defining multi-key hotkeys, backspace might clear only the last &#34;keystroke&#34; until all are cleared and then exit.







5. Add context menu to hotkey selection field  

(Some of these are incredibly picky.  I hope polishing WK will help it succeed.)";
