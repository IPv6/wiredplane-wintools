$psubject="Enhancements to Change Case of Selected Text -- Cycle Case (or Menu); Maintain Selection ";
$pcontent="Enhancement - Change operation of &#34;change case of selected text&#34; to cycle between lowercase, Sentence case, Initial Capital (Word Case), and UPPERCASE.

Alternative - Upon keypress, display a small menu that offers a choice of 
   L/N - lower or normal, 
   S/I - sentence or initial, 
   T/W - title or word, and 
   U/C - upper or capital.  

* Some people will relate more to one set of terms than the other, so both are presented in the menu.
* Offering both sets of abbreviations facilitates use when both hands are on the keyboard (given the awkward reach for Alt-` that mispositions the left hand) as well as when one hand is on the keyboard and one is on the mouse.
* When a single word is selected, S/I/T/W have the same result.
* All of this could be implemented by creating a Change Case floating menu except for supporting multiple shortcuts for a menu item.  (Some of you may see a way to do even that.)

Enhancement - After changing text, leave the (changed) text selected.
