$rcontent="Hello!
Can you try the following to help us track this issue futher? When you have a time for this of course
1) download WK 3.4.3, install it and run
2) Open preferences, enable &#34;Autotext&#34; plugin (you can disable it after all)
3) Open &#34;Settings&#34;-&#62;&#34;Additional settings&#34;-&#62;&#34;Write debug log&#34; (last checkbox in the right pane)
4) restart WK.
5) Look on any hotkey with @FJ key in it (in preferences). Notice the number that will be shown after it (Hotkey will look like &#39;A[#0000004D]-@FJ[a342f645]&#39;)
6) Make screenshot of this hotkey with this number fully visible and send it to us :)
7) Disable debug log (see 3) and restart WK again

We will release new version with this strange key blocked down";
