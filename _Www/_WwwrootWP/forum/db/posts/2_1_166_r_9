$rcontent="can you try WK 3.4.2? when you`ll have spare time for trying of course.

to create debug log to help us find the reason of the bug, open preferences-&#62;global option-&#62;additional options-&#62;WireNote integration (last checkbox). check it and restart WK.
after that try to start different links by hotkey. wiredplane_debug.log in the c:// will be created.

you can read it and modify if you find something to be private, path to lnk files for example. 

if this is possible - replace several characters by * char in strings that you find private to scrable them, but leave whole structure intact.

then send the log to us.";
