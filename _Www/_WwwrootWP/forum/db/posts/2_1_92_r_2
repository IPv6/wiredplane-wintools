I can hotkey the DOS version of the virusscanner, but not the graphical interface that comes up when right-clicking a file and selecting the shell extension &#39;Scan with AVG Free&#39;. Is it possible to call the shellext via the application path in the macro?

The shellext is:
Filename          : C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Grisoft&#92;AVG Free&#92;avgse.dll
CLSID             : {9F97547E-4609-42C5-AE0C-81C61FFAEBC3}

TIA";
