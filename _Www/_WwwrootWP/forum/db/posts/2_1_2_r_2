2Zup:
File path: in fact, if you press &#34;Additional clipboard - Copy&#34; hotkey upon any file in any browser, you will copy it`s path into corresponding additional clip
Send key with hotkey: right now this can be done with special macro, it`s SendKeys command. You can assign MMKey to call the macro and macro will send &#34;Ctrl-Z&#34; with SendKeys command (see Help-Macro page). We are planning to write macro recorder in the near future to make such task easier to perform.

I&#39;d love if:
* if I select a file or folder in Explorer and press a combination of keys I could copy path and/or file name to clipboard
* I can make my MMkeys act like a combination. i.e. press &#34;volume up&#34; MMkey acts like press &#34;CTRL-Z&#34;

Very good work! Version 2.1 solved every problem! Thanks a lot!

2Zup: can you send us error text with disabled plugin? We checked this on WinME - everything ok (without plugin enabled). and about you MMKeyboard - whch text appears in the hotkeys when you trying to set additional keys? and try to disable keyboard`s software - this can intercept keyboard input for WireKeys

2rij73: &#34;free memory&#34; trade RAM memory for virtual memory. So if the running application is not active it can be completely unloaded into swap file. but if all applications uses memory a lot this function is not able to free anything. We are planning to add registry optiomization and disk-cash flushing to this option in the future

Could you explain the Memory Optimize feature a little? I have noticed that sometimes when I select it, no memory gets free, and sometimes a lot of memory gets free. Is this supposed to be this way?

Downloaded 2.0.3... disabled &#34;Wired key combinations&#34; plugin... sigh... still crashes under Win98... :&#39;-(

2Roger: we can add such feature but to add support for depress action we need your help (cos we don`t have mouse with such action, wheel click is equivalent to middle button click). Please, write an email to us 
2Zup: we are working on it. as a workaround we can advice to disable &#34;Wired key combinations&#34; under Windows 98, until we found a problem on that problem
