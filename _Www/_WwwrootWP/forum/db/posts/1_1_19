$psubject="Problem with MAPI2POP3 and multiple sets of folders";
$pcontent="Hi,

Today the IT folks had to change something to my Outlook configuration.

I now have a list of folders  called &#34;Mailbox - Barizien, Stephane&#34; (server-based, if I understood correctly) and another one called &#34;Personal Folders.&#34;

New messages get delivered to the Inbox folder within &#34;Mailbox - Barizien, Stephane&#34;. This cannot be changed.

Under these conditions, MAPI2POP3 does *retrieve* the messages but is unable to *delete* them. When mapi_EnsureMessages is called the second time to delete messages, the values of frows-&#62;cRows after

...
{// Loading emails in the folder
IMAPITable *contents=0;
HRESULT hr = ifolder-&#62;GetContentsTable(0,&contents);
								if (hr==S_OK){ 
									SizedSPropTagArray(8,foldcols) = {8, {PR_ENTRYID,PR_SUBJECT,PR_SENT_REPRESENTING_NAME,PR_MESSAGE_DELIVERY_TIME,PR_MESSAGE_SIZE,PR_TRANSPORT_MESSAGE_HEADERS,PR_INTERNET_MESSAGE_ID,PR_SMTP_MESSAGE_ID}};
									SRowSet *frows=0;
hr = pHrQueryAllRows(contents,(SPropTagArray*)&foldcols,NULL,NULL,0,&frows);
...


is ALWAYS zero.

It seems MAPI2POP3 enumerates for reading all messages from all &#34;Inbox&#34; folders, but enumerates for deletion only the messages from the &#34;Inbox&#34; folder under &#34;Personal Folders.&#34;

My current workaround is to have a rule that automatically moves all messages from the &#34;Mailbox - Inbox&#34; to the &#34;Personal Folders - Inbox&#34;.

Any clue?";
