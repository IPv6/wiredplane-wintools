$rcontent="Most interesting... I&#39;m not yet familiar with the language, but I can see approximately what&#39;s going on. So %Selected works in command line? Odd, they told me in an IRC help chatroom that there was no such variable that would work like that.

Sorry to spam you with questions, but, on the topic of variables, I was just wondering if there was a way to specify the %DATE format shown when doing ALT+D (default). It&#39;s currently in DD.MM.YYYY format, and I&#39;d like to do YYYYMMDD. I tried &#36;%Date:YYYYMMDD%&#36; which I saw on some other site, but that obviously didn&#39;t work.

Also, I didn&#39;t see a spot to report a bug, so I guess I&#39;ll note it here: Under &#34;Desktop, Icons, and Windows&#62;Active Window and Processes&#62;Mouse Gestures,&#34; there are two items that don&#39;t appear to behave correctly for me. When I enable &#34;Dock to screen border on window&#39;s border right-click&#34; it does nothing on right click and only moves (docks?) when using left click (both on window-adjust hover, of course). Then, when enabling &#34;Expand to fit screen on window&#39;s border double right-click or single middle-click,&#34; it expands to fit (fullscreen) on single right-click (or middle, of course). I was curious this was just me or everyone; and, if everyone, if they will be updated sometime in the future, preferably to be customizeable so that I could set perhaps 2x@MMB to be &#34;fill&#34; and 2x@RMB to be &#34;dock.&#34; :)

Thanks again for all your help,
