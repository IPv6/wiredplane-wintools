$rcontent="Just experimented with moving the second monitor above or below the primary monitor.  Results were consistent:

With the secondary monitor positioned &#34;above&#34; the primary monitor (top-left corner at 0x-720), WC generates a 1600x2640 image, with a 1600x1200 image centered within, with blank 1600x720 borders above and below (and the widgets positioned correctly).

With the secondary monitor positioned &#34;below&#34; the primary monitor (top-left corner at 0x1200), WC generates a 1600x1920 image, with a 1600x1200 image centered within, and a 1280x720 image at the bottom (widgets still positioned correctly).

Note that I had to restart WC after each change of the monitor position before the behavior actually changed.

Hope this helps!   ;)  Let me know if you want me to e-mail any of these images.";
