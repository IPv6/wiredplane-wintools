Theres a Microsoft PowerToy called &#34;Command Here&#34; which adds an option to the shell menu &#34;Open Command Window Here&#34; which when clicks opens a CMD window with the base folder the folder you right clicked.
The problem with the PowerToy is that it will only show up when you right click a FOLDER in explorer.  So for example when you right click the Desktop, for example, there is no &#34;Open Command Window Here&#34; option.  To get that option on the Desktop folder, you have to browse to &#34;C:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;&#60;UserName&#62;&#92;&#34; and right click the Desktop folder.

Im just suggesting a plugin that has the same functionality as the PowerToy but can open the CMD window when right clicking inside an open window (ShellToysXP has this ability...but I dont feel like running that program anymore).";
