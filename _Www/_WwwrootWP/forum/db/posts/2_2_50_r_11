1) Screensaver works great!  :thmbup

2) Wallpaper is now thoroughly messed up.   :tear

My main display is showing just the edge of an image, with the secondary display being blank.

Looking at the IPv6WallPaper.bmp file, it&#39;s now a 4160(!) x 1200 image.  There&#39;s a 1600x1200 image in the center, with 1280x1200 blank borders on the left & right edges.  The widgets (calendar, citations, etc.) are in the correct locations.";
