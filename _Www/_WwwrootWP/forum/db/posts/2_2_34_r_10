$rcontent="Wow!! :) Thank you very much for such a full investigation! :) It seems that things are clear now and they are much easier to handle as i thought before (i should check the image - it is still in the way (btw, 3.3 mb is ok - but the idea is clear). i think that ATI and others will share the same behaviour, because MS documentation contain description for similar things.
We are starting ti implement nomal support for dual monitors, thank you very much, again!
BTW version of WC with fixed screensaver will be ready today, i`ll post message when it will be uploaded for download :)";
