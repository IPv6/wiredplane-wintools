$psubject="Problem when used with 2 monitors";
$pcontent="Hello,
I just download the lastest version of wirenote (3.0) and it it doesn&#39;t manage well the fact that I&#39;ve got two monitors. Wirenote seems to record its position relatively to a single screen each time I close it, but when I open it again, this position is then relative to the two monitors, and I can then only see the top of the window. Hope you understand my explanation :? However it&#39;s annoying, and I come back to the last version, which worked properly, waiting for someone to explain me if it can be fix

thanx
