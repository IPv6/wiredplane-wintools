$pcontent="Hi all.

I have been using WireNote for several months now; and I&#39;m very impressed with it. Actually, I wouldn&#39;t know to do without it.

But there is something I&#39;ve never been able to figure out. I have a meeting every first Tuesday of the month. Is there a way to create a reminder with that date parameter?

If not, this would be a nice feature to add, I think.

Thanks,

GE";
