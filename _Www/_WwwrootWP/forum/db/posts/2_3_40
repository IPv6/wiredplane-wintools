$pcontent="Hi Guys,

first of all: WireNote seems like a neat tool. Thanks for providing it for free. Being a freeware software author myself, I know the amount of time the developer ends up spending on the tools; but at the end, users do appreciate it.

Now, I have some suggestions. 

1) Would it be possible to disable some functions in WireNote? It may sound like a strange request, but there are some good reasons. Presently, I am using WireNote only for Reminders. Once I get a bit more used to it, I can imaging I would use ToDo and Notes a lot more. However, I wouldn&#39;t be using any of the Network feature, Address book, or Mail checker. By having a disabling feature option, we can then have a much neater right-click on tray-icon: or perhaps even allow the user to customize right-click tray-icon.

2) Option to choose a user directory from the software instead of command line parameters. For backup purposes, I like to keep all my data file in different drive that windows. I looked through all the option in preferences several times before finding the &#34;Profile&#34; folder option in help manual.

3) Searchable CHM file

Thanks again for a lovely software.

regards
