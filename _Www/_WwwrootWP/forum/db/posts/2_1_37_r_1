The difference is that we will add configurable folders (not recent, but this is not a point - you just have to define all your favourite folders one time and use them forever). And our plugin will work not only in the save/load dialogs, but in the ordinary Explorer windows too (in other words, you will be able to just into any favourite folder in one click from any location)";
