$pcontent="I have been mumbling about this problem for some time, now here is my &#34;official&#34; cry for help.

I find the taskbar extender one of the most useful plug-ins, and I use it all day and everyday.
But, after a few minutes of creating floaters, moving the order of the icons and general use, I find that the first one or even two icons always disappears BEHIND the Windows Start button ( which I also use to display % of cpu). It can only be corrected by a re-logging on to PC.

I have never seen anyone else report this problem, so either it is just with Windows 2000Pro, as I use, or it must be my system. But it happens on all three of my PC&#39;s. Naturally, I can supply a screen shot if it is of any help. Hope someone can suggest a work-around? thnaks. Ian.";
