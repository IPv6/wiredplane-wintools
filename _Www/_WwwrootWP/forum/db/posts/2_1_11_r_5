$rcontent="Hotkey Guide Enhancement Request

1. Multikey autoreduces on all characters in multicharacter hotkeys (e.g., press either &#34;R&#34; or &#34;W&#34; and show Win-R-W).

1A. Option (or standard behavior) so that modifier key press-n-hold (based on preference for delay?) autoreduces hotkey guide (e.g., press-n-hold Win displays Win-R-W and Win-G).

-----
Am I overlooking some obvious reason why these are not good ideas?  Technically infeasible?

Thanks,
