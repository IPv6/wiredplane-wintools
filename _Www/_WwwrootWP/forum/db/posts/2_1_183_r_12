$rcontent="Hello,

Yes i have the last version of WK v3.4.3.  And the problem is still remain.

My hotkeys (all) function  randomly.
When my Hotkey Guide (DEFIL) is open i see this.

On 10 press of the same hotkey (CTRL+ALT+Right) i see this in guide:

CTRL-Alt-Right
CTRL-Alt-Right@FJ
CTRL-Alt-Right@FJ
CTRL-Alt-Right@FJ
CTRL-Alt-Right@FJ
CTRL-Alt-Right
CTRL-Alt-Right@FJ
CTRL-Alt-Right@FJ
CTRL-Alt-Right
CTRL-Alt-Right@FJ

The hotkey is pressed at each 5 secondes.
No interaction between each hotkey.  all program turned of except Winamp (for hotkey)

i think that if wirekeys can exclude the &#34;@FJ&#34; the problem could be corrected.

thanks
