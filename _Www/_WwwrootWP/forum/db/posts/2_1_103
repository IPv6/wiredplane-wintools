$psubject="Strange Start Button Behaviour";
$pcontent="Using the % CPU on start button, also the Taskbar button plug-in, but the first icon in tray is always pushed into hiding BEHIND the Start button !

Is this just in Windows 2000K ? Is there an easy work-around for this as it happens on my 2 other PC&#39;s too? Thanks for any help. Ian.";
