$psubject="[PLUGIN IDEA] Baby-protect (block kb/mouse)";
$pcontent="Hi,
I have the following suggestion for plugin.

Is it possible to lock WHOLE keyboard (with exception of unlocking combination - something like Ctrl+Win+App+U )?
This will give me (as a parent) the possibility to read something from the screen, while my child is playing with the keyboard. 

And, vice versa, is it possible to completely block the mouse? (small children always play with the same things as parents)

So, it should be the plugin with the following functionality:
 - lock/unlock keyboard
 - lock/unlock mouse
 - (last, but not least) block &#34;Standby&#34;(or similar) button
