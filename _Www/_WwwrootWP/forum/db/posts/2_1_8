Separate forum for Preferences for each product
Separate forum for developer discussion
Separate forum for documentation

Perhaps (off the top of my head) for each product something like:
WK Announcements, Product FAQ, Forum Decorum
WK Use - &#34;How do I?&#34; for WK and default plugins and macros (list 4 plugs, macros beginning with xxx)
WK Use - &#34;How do I?&#34; for other plug-ins and macros
WK Bug Reports
WK Enhancement Requests
WK Programming - Coding new plugins and macros

Alternatively, add some subject specific &#34;post icons&#34; (e.g., &#34;bug&#34; or plus sign for new feature/enhancement) 
or tooltips for existing icons (e.g., &#34;question&#34; for 
questionmark; ) 
while removing ambiguous icons (what is difference between thumb up/down and smile/frown icons?).


Also, where should off topic posts go?  The Off-Topic icon is handy, but perhaps it should be available for the thread";
