$rcontent="it seems that this is something in driver.
did you haev distrib of it? can you send it?
we can also prepare debug version with some logging about this FJ key. i think we can mask it from wirekeys and it will be ok. i think that this key is used by driver to distinguish some additional keyboard fetures.
BTW, can it be that this key is present according to some of the additional keys at your new keyboard?
Sorry for inconvinience :(";
