$pcontent="Hello. i am new to the site and i am needing some help. I am looking to purchasing Wire Changer and i am really liking what i see from the trial version. I am looking to purchase a small business license but, I am not sure on how many computers that actually covers or if it is just one license i can use multiple times. I know that the single license covers 3 computers but i am not wanting to buy multiple licenses if the small business will accommodate what my needs are If i could get some help on this issue i would be greatly appreciative. thank you!";
