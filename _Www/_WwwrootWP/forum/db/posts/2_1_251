$pcontent="Hi guys,

last weekend I was happy to translate WK main module into German.

Last German version was of approx. 2004.
Now it is of WK 3.6.3.
Added 500 hundred lines.
And corrected the other if necessary.

I sent the correspondig file to WireKeys-at-wiredplane.com.
Would be fine to have it in the next release.

Richy.
