$rcontent="i see... can you help us the last time?
1) Open preferences, switch to system options and check the last checkbox in the right pane (Log debug on disk)
2) Restart WireChanger (again... :)
3) Switch wallpaper several times
4) Find wallpaper image that was generated for desktop and add on it two rectangles (in paint application, for example) - what part of the image is visible on Primary monitor and another one is what you see on the secondary monitor (you don`t to be very accurate here :^)
5) zip image with file c:&#92;wiredplane_debug.log (it will be auto created) and send it to us?
6) Undo change from the point 1 to stop WC from updating wiredplane_debug.log

This will be sufficient for us to finish the work :)
Thank you in advance!";
