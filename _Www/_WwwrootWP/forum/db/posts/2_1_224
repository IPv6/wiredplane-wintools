$pcontent="Hi. I use the processes list all the time and I&#39;d like to request a few additions:

1) The ability to turn the process viewer on/off by pressing the same hotkey.
2) The option to make the list one column instead of defaulting to two columns.
3) The ability to define where the process list pops up (simple- left side, right side, center, @mouse cursor)
4) The option to show the full-path of the process, not just the name.
5) The ability to add other Windows performance counters (such as memory usage) to the list. 

The last one I think would add a great deal of power, with not much code bloat, as Wirekeys could become a front end to all the Windows performance data using the same windowing system.";
