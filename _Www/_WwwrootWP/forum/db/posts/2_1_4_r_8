 I just find why it`s happen :) As always, this is undocumented behaviour of windows: the problem is in explorer. You have to remove Ctrl key from hotkey combination (you can assign Win-Up, for example, just like in WinKey), because holding this key during maximize sends explorer to fullscreen! and this effect can be reproduced without WireKeys or hotkeys at all:
- Open explorer
- Press alt-space to open Explorer`s system menu
- Press and hold &#34;CTRL&#34; key
- Choose &#34;Maximize&#34; from this system menu
- Oops! Explorer maximizes itself into full screen!

When using hotkey with CTRL, explorer handle this key regardless of other programs and there is no way to tell him not to &#34;listen&#34; for CTRL :( :bulb :bulb";
