I like the WK but, something is wrong (perhaps in my environment). I have tried to add
an application,it worked fine until
the first shutdown. By the new start it dissapeared!

any chance of getting this program to remember changes to preferences in windows98???

Daniel: Just hit Ctrl-Alt and the Number Pad&#39;s Minus key. The menu will pop up allowing you to click Preferences.

Fantastic app! Unfortunately, in the preferences, I disabled the tray icon. Is there any way I can now change the preferences?

Very nice program. I do have a question though; does the &#34;Additional options -&#62; Distance to stick windows together (pix)&#34; option work on Windows XP? I have not noticed any stickiness at all.
