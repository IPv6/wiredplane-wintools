Just a question: What did you mean under &#34;open the CMD window when right clicking inside an open window&#34; - open Explorer window or any window?[/quote]

hmm how to explain this...

Open up your c drive, or whatever drive.
You will see files, folders and just the blank white area, depending on how large your window is.  Hmm, that doesnt work to well...um...

Just open an empty folder.  An empty folder.  If you right click anywhere in the place where files WOULD be listed, you get a menu with view, arrange icons, refresh, customize this folder..., etc.
That menu is where i would like to see the open command window.  And it would open a command window in the folder that you are right clicking in.

If you would like me to take a few screenies i wont mind.";
