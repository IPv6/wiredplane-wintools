$pcontent="Hello,

just tested the new version (3.3.0)
Thank You for Your work!

Some remarks:
1) Application quick-run, item &#34;If You already started this application&#34;: the list doesn&#39;t have the most important action &#34;Switch to the opened instance&#34; (&#34;Don&#39;t start new instance&#34; is not very clear).
The switch to the existing instance doesn&#39;t work (at least, in my tests) if the application is minimized to trace.

2) There is no confirmation window for delete action in Application quick run. This could be really dangerous...

3) Is is possible to avoid refresh of the Preferences window after the Apply operation?

4) In some combination with &#34;Win&#34; key the Start Menu is still displayed. It&#39;s very inconvenient...
