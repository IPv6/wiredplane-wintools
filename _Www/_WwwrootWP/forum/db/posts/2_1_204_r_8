$rcontent="I am very happy that you have recreated the problem and found the solution!  Thank you  :)

I can try to reinstall the beta and tell you more about the freezing ... Depends on time ...

Also to let you know ... the shell extender plugin was never enabled.  When I go there, it has a link to enable it and there is no checkmark in the box.

Thanks!!!";
