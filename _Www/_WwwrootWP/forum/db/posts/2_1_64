$pcontent="Hi. Would it be possible to modify the following two actions:

1) After a &#39;Minimize&#39;, could a double press of that hotkey restore the window? There already is a separate hotkey for rollup, and after a window minimizes i think the only way to restore it by hotkey is to Alt-Tab it.

2) For the &#39;Window&#39;s Helper&#39; plugin, the window snapping is inconsistent. When I move a window with &#39;Linux-like windows move&#39;, it won&#39;t snap upon release. Same with moving windows via &#39;Active Window&#39;s Scrolling&#39;. The software &#39;AllSnap&#39; (which I love but am still trying to replace with Wirekeys) auto-snaps windows to borders during moves, but lets you keep moving the window if desired.

Thanks!";
