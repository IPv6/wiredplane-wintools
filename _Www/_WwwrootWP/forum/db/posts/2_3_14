$pcontent="Is the command line switches of WireNote 2.6.0 such as the -io works? I&#39;m trying this software and I can&#39;t make it work by issuing the command line &#34;wirenote -io &#60;path&#62;&#92;wirenote.conf&#34;. That command was executed within the folder where Wirenote was installed and the wirenote.conf file was copied from a previously configured computer. No help file about this matter can be found in your site nor in the Web.

Moreover, I can&#39;t make the Shared Reminders to work. I enabled shared reminder and specified a shared folder in the configuration. I enabled shared reminder option in the New Reminder window but the reminder won&#39;t pop up to other computers despite I configured those computers for shared reminders. Any help will be appreciated.

Hopefully, the documentation for WireNote is more comprehensively written.

Pls. point me to the proper site if this message is not appropriate for this forum. Thanks.
