$pcontent="Hi. I have a couple requests that I think will greatly add to Wirekeys&#39; power, but not bloat the code. As far as I know some of these functions do not exist in any standalone
apps; I don&#39;t know if they all are possible (I am not a coder), but I think that if they are possible, many people will find them useful.

They fall into two main categories. The first is Window manipulation. Currently with Wirekeys, one can maximize, minimize, shade, hide, and tray a window easily. This is awesome. I would like to see this go further and manipulate windows by hotkey to:

-move any window x number of pixels in any of 8 directions (left/right/up/down/diagonals) without having to use the windows&#39; context menu (Alt-Space-M) and arrow keys.

-move any window to one of 10 locations on the screen: center, bottom right, bottom center, bottom left, center left, center right, top left, top center, top right. The software &#39;Freeshade (http://www.hmmn.org/FreeShade/)&#39; does this, and it is very very convenient.
(Freeshade also does something very cool, which is to maximize a window horizontally or vertically only, and not to the entire screen. It&#39;s neat and worth checking out.)

The second category is Explorer folder manipulation. The ability to hotkey the following would be super cool:

-Change a folder&#39;s view setting. Ex: Ctrl-Alt-u changes current explorer window to &#39;List&#39; view, Ctrl-Alt-i changes explorer window to &#39;Details&#39; view, etc.

-Fully expand the contents of chosen columns in a folder window, and auto-resize the window to fit the expanded columns. Here&#39;s screenshots for what I mean:

It would also be hugely handy if this could be done with open/save dialogues (there was a piece of software some years ago that did this, but forget the name now), but I am guessing that this adds another level of complexity.

Thanks for any response!

PS- I asked that you add the ability to backup Wirekeys&#39; configuration to a file about a year ago. It works great- thanks for adding it  :)
