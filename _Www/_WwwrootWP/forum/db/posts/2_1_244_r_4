$rcontent="I checked this CLSID and unfortunately it can not be used with WireKeys by now :( There are different methods of activation COM objects identified with such codes, called CLSIDs. This one can not be called without exact folder with options you trying to change. I`ll think about how it can be called from WK and add changes to future releases.

BTW, nice collection of Win-related stuff (including CLSIDs of  different system utilities, buried inside admin options. Most of them can be used with WK using method described earlier)
