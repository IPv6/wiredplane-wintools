$pcontent="Hey all - haven&#39;t downloaded WireKeys yet - but here&#39;s my question.  I was looking for a simple program that could launch programs/folders with hotkeys.  It&#39;s a little unclear if WireKeys does this - is it possible?

It looks like Wirekeys does MUCH more - I&#39;m interested in playing with it&#39;s extended functionality, but that basic feature is what I need.

Thanks!";
