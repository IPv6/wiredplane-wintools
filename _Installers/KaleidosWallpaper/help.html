<tr><td colspan=2>This is simple wallpaper generator, based on interesting effect called Kaleidoscope.
The only thing you should set up before first run is image directory. By default it is "My pictures" folder, but you may want to set it to your local gallery path.
KaleidosWallpaper can work on almost any images, so don`t worry. 
<hr>This software is absolutely free for everyone. 
But if you find it interesting you can donate us for future development (<a href="http://www.wiredplane.com/order.shtml">Donate!</a>).
<br>KaleidosWallpaper does not contain any spyware or adware of any kind.
<hr>
