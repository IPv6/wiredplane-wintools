<h1>WireChanger Overview</h1><hr>
Desktop manager with active clocks utility.
Brand new wallpaper changer, which can do the magic with your desktop background. 
Features customizable templates (interactive clickable calendar, picture mixer, memo pad and more) 
with all popular options. Your desktop can be enlivened with real clocks (from huge ColClocks collection) and clickable sticky notes. 
Built-in support for all major image formats: gif / jpg / bmp / ...; Additional great feature - ability to show HTML pages or on-line URLs. 
WireChanger can automatically apply special effects to the image (B&W/Emboss/Water or color dispositions...) on the fly. Images can be grouped by 
theme, each with its own weight. The weight determines how often theme`s images will appear in the wallpaper rotation. Themes can be synchronized with specific 
folder and all new images will be automatically added at WireChanger startup.
<br><br>Wallpaper can be colored and altered with special templates. Template can overlay your desktop 
background with useful information, for example weather forecast or famous people`s random citation. Another template transforms your image into 
handy calendar for 2 weeks or a current month with interactive day-by-day notes. You can just double-click calendar`s cell to 
add some notes for that day. Double-click calendar`s title to popup calendar for 4 months. You don`t have to search icons in your tray or 
remember special hotkeys to popup main window - just double-click your wallpaper! Believe me, this is as easy as it`s sounds! In addition to this, WireChanger can add to your desktop analog or 
digital clocks or wrist-watches from ColClocks collection. You can also download small utility "Desktop FlashGen" and create interactive desktop from your favourite flash file as well. 
And finally you can bring the real life to your desktop with special animation effects - like water, matrix and others. They will not use your CPU - they will use your 
3D card instead. You will never see the same picture on your desktop! :) If you want to see something fresh every 
time you minimizing your applications to start something from your desktop - WireChanger is solution.
