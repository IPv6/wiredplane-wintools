<h1>WireChanger FAQ</h1><hr>

<LI><b>Q:</b> I set up weight for some of my themes, but now I want to remove weight. How can I do that?<br>

<LI><b>Q:</b> WireChanger can`t make my desktop icons transparent. Why?<br>
A: If you are using active clocks, the problem is in the windows system itself. WindowsXP of certain editions are unable to depict transparent icons when Active Desktop is enabled. Microsoft confirmed this to be a bug. If you are not use active clocks - email us about this problem

<LI><b>Q:</b> Sometimes WireChanger does not change anything on my desktop. OS - Windows XP<br>

<br><br></LI>
<LI><b>Q:</b> What does it mean - exceptional conditions?<br>
A: Exceptional conditions are situations in which wallpaper changer can interfere with work of other applications. Processing of new wallpaper is very CPU and memory consuming operation. During processing WireChanger can steal CPU resources from such important task as burning CD-R disk, for example. To avoid similar problems, WireChanger can temporarily disable image rotation, until CPU and memory usage falls back to the usual level.

A: Yes. New languages will be added later. In order to speed up this process you can translate WireChanger_l0.lng file and send it to us in exchange for free registration key
